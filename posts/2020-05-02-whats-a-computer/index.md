title: what's a computer?
---

How many computers do you have? Do own just an iPhone, the pocket
computer? Do you have an Apple Watch, the wrist computer? Do you have
a laptop or desktop, the general purpose computers? Do you have a
Raspberry Pi, the hobbyist computer? All of these are types of
computers. But what does it mean for a device to be a computer?
Furthermore, what does it mean for a device to be a *good* computer?
In this article, I will give my thoughts on the question posed in
Appleâ€™s [what's a
computer](https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/16/ipad-pro-whats-a-computer-ad/)
ad for the iPad Pro. I will be focusing on people who are blind, but
this should spark conversation across all kinds of people with needs
other than Facebook and social media.
