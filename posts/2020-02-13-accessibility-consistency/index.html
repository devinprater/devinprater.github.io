<p>This article will explore Apple’s consistent attention to accessibility,
and how other tech companies with commitments to accessibility, like
Microsoft and Google, compare to Apple in their accessibility efforts.
It also shows where these companies can improve their consistency, and
that no company is perfect at being an Assistive Technology provider
yet.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple has shown a commitment to
<a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/">accessibility</a> since the early
days of the iPhone, and since mac OSX Tiger. Its VoiceOver screen reader
was the first built-in screen reader of any usability on a personal
computer and smart phone. Now, VoiceOver is on every Apple product, even
the HomePod. It is so prevalent that people I know have begun calling
any screen reader “VoiceOver.” This level of consistency should be
congratulated in a company of Apple’s size and wealth. But is this a
continual trend, and what does this mean for competitors?</p>
<p>This will be an opinion piece. I will not stick only to the facts as we
have them, and won’t give sources for everything which I show as fact.
This article is a testament to how accessibility can be made a
fundamental part of a brand’s experience for effected people, so
feelings and opinions will be involved.</p>
<h2>The trend of accessibility</h2>
<p>The following sections of the article will explore companies trends of
accessibility so far. The focus is on Apple, but I’ll also show some of
what its competitors have done over the years as well. As Apple has a
greater following of blind people, and Applevis has documented so much
of Apple’s progress, I can show more of it than I can its competitors,
whose information written by their followers are scattered, thus harder
to search for.</p>
<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>Apple has a history of accessibility, shown by <a href="http://maccessibility.net/2011/02/10/blind-faith-a-decade-of-apple-accessibility">this
article</a>.
Written just under a decade ago, it goes over the previous decade’s
advancements. As that article has done, I will focus on little of a
company’s talk of accessibility, but more so its software releases and
services.</p>
<p>Apple is, by numbers and satisfaction, the leader in accessibility for
users of its mobile operating systems, but not in general purpose
computer operating systems. Microsoft’s Windows is used far more than
Apple’s MacOS. Besides that, and services, Apple has made its VoiceOver
screen reader on iOS much more powerful, and even flexible, than its
competitor, Google’s TalkBack.</p>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<p>As iPhones were released each year, so were newer versions of iOS. In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-accessibility-ios-6">iOS 6</a>,
accessibility settings began working together, VoiceOver’s Rotor gained
a few new abilities, new braille displays worked with VoiceOver, and
bugs were fixed. In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-and-changed-blind-and-low-vision-users-ios-71">iOS 7</a>,
we gained the ability to have more than one high quality voice, more
Rotor options, and the ability to write text using handwriting.</p>
<p>Next,
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-ios-8-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 8</a>
was pretty special to me, personally, as it introduced the method of
writing text that I almost always use now, Braille Screen Input. This
lets me type on the screen of my phone in braille, making my typing
exponentially faster. Along with typing, I can delete text, a word or
character, and now, send messages from within the input mode. I can also
change braille contraction levels, and lock orientation into one of two
typing modes. Along with this, Apple added the Alex voice, its most
natural yet, which was only before available on a Mac. For those who do
not know braille or handwriting, a new “direct touch typing” method
allows a user to type as quickly as a sighted person, if they can
memorize exactly where the keys are, or have spell check and
autocorrection enabled.</p>
<p>In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-and-changed-ios-9-accessibility-blind-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 9</a>,
VoiceOver users are able to choose Siri voices to speak using VoiceOver,
as an extension of the list of Vocalizer voices, and Apple’s Alex voice.
One can now control speech rate more easily, and the speed of speech can
be greater than previously possible. One can control the time a double
tap should take, a better method of selecting text, braille screen input
improvements, and braille display fixes and new commands.</p>
<p>Then,
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-ios-10-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 10</a>
arrived, with a new way to organize apps, a pronunciation dictionary,
even more voices, reorganized settings, new sounds for actions, a way to
navigate threaded email, and some braille improvements. One great thing
about the pronunciation editor is that it does not only apply to the
screen reader, as in many Windows screen readers, but to the entire
system speech. So, if you use VoiceOver, but also Speak Screen, both
will speak as you have set them to. This is a testament to Apple’s
attention to detail, and control of the entire system.</p>
<p>With the release of
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-ios-11-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 11</a>,
we gained the ability to type to Siri, new Siri voices, verbosity
settings, the ability to have subtitles read or brailled, and the
ability to change the speaking pitch of the voice used by VoiceOver.
VoiceOver can now describe some images, which will be greatly expanded
later. We can now find misspelled words, which will also be expanded
later. One can now add and change commands used by braille displays,
which, yes, will be expanded upon later. A few things which haven’t been
expanded upon yet are the ability to read formatting, however imprecise,
with braille “status cells,” and the “reading” of Emoji. Word wrap and a
few other braille features were also added.</p>
<p>Last year, in
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/apple-releases-ios-12-bringing-new-and-enhanced-features-and-performance-improvements">iOS 12</a>,
Apple added commands to jump to formatted text for braille display
users, new Siri voices, verbosity options, confirmation of rotor actions
and sent messages, expansion of the “misspelled” rotor option for
correcting the misspelled word, and the ability to send VoiceOver to an
HDMI output.</p>
<p>Finally, In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-ios-13-accessibility-individuals-who-are-blind-or-deaf-blind">iOS 13</a>,
Apple moved accessibility to the main settings list, out of the General
section, provided even more natural Siri voices, haptics for VoiceOver,
to aid alongside, or replace, the sounds already present, and the
ability to modify or turn them off. A “vertical scroll bar” has also
been added, as another method of scrolling content. VoiceOver can now
give even greater suggestions for taking pictures, aligning the camera,
and with the iPhone 11, what will be in the picture. One can also
customize commands for the touch screen, braille display, and keyboard,
expanding the ability braille users already had. One can even assign
Siri shortcuts to a VoiceOver command, as Mac users have been able to do
with Apple Script. One can now have VoiceOver interpret charts and
graphs, either via explanations of data, or by an audible representation
of them. This may prove extremely useful in education, and for
visualizing data of any type. Speaking detected text has improved over
the versions to include the detecting of text in unlabeled controls, and
now can attempt to describe images as well. Braille users now have
access to many new braille tables, like Esperanto and several other
languages, although braille no longer switches languages along with
speech.</p>
<h3>MacOS</h3>
<p>MacOS has not seen so much improvement in accessibility over the years.
VoiceOver isn’t a bad screen reader, though. It can be controlled using
a trackpad, which no other desktop screen reader can boast. It can be
used to navigate and activate items with only the four arrow keys. It
uses the considerable amount of voices available on the Mac and for
download. It simply isn’t updated nearly as often as VoiceOver for iOS.</p>
<p>OSX 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9 have seen a few new features, like more
VoiceOver voices, braille improvement, and other things. I couldn’t find
much before Sierra, so we’ll start there.</p>
<p>In Sierra, Apple added VoiceOver commands for controlling volume, to
offset the absence of the physical function keys in new MacBook models.
VoiceOver can also now play a sound for row changes in apps like Mail,
instead of interrupting itself to announce “one row added,” because
Apple’s speech synthesis server on the Mac doesn’t innately support a
speech queue. This means that neither does VoiceOver, so interruptions
must be worked around. Some announcements were changed, HTML content
became web areas, and interaction became “in” and “out of” items. There
were also bug fixes in this release.</p>
<p>In High Sierra, one can now type to Siri, VoiceOver can now switch
languages when reading multilingual text, as VoiceOver on the iPhone has
been able to do since iOS 5 at least, improved braille editing and PDF
reading support, image descriptions, and improved HTML 5 support.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/new-features-changes-and-accessibility-bugs-macos-mojave-blind-and-low-vision-users">MacOS
Mojave</a>,
Apple added the beginning of new iPad apps on Mac. These apps work
poorly with VoiceOver, even still in Catalina. There were no new
reported VoiceOver features in this release.</p>
<p>This year, In <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/new-features-changes-improvements-and-bugs-macos-catalina-blind-and-low-vision-users">MacOS
Catalina</a>,
Apple added more control of punctuation, and XCode 11’s text editor is
now a little more accessible, even though the Playgrounds function
isn’t, and the Books app can now, after years of being on the Mac, be
used for basic reading of books. Braille tables from iOS 13 are also
available in MacOS.</p>
<h3>The future of Apple accessibility</h3>
<p>All of these changes, however, were discovered by users. Apple doesn’t
really talk about all of its accessibility improvements, just some of
the highlights. While I see great potential in accessible diagrams and
graphs, Apple didn’t mention this, and users had to find this.
Subsequently, there may be fixes and features that we still haven’t
found, three versions of iOS 13 later. Feedback between Apple and its
customers has never been great, and this is only to Apple’s detriment.
Since Apple rarely responds to little feedback, users feel that their
feedback doesn’t mean anything, so they stop sending it. Also of note is
that on VoiceOver’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/">Mac accessibility
page</a>, the “Improved
PDF, web, and messages navigation” section is from macOS 10.13, two
versions behind what is currently new in VoiceOver.</p>
<p>Another point is that services haven’t been the most accessible. Chief
among them is Apple Arcade, which <a href="https://applevis.com/forum/apple-arcade-anyone">has no accessible
games</a>, so far. Apple
research, I’ve found, has some questions which have answers that are
simply unlabeled buttons. While Apple TV Plus has audio description for
all of their shows, this is a minor glimmer of light, shrouded by the
inaccessibility of Apple Arcade, which features, now, over one hundred
games, none of which I can play with any success. In all fairness, a
blind person who is patient may be able to play a game like Dear Reader,
which has some accessible items, but the main goal of that game is to
find a word in a different color and correct it, which is completely at
odds with complete blindness, but could be handled using speech
parameter changes, audio cues, or other signals of font, color, or style
changes.</p>
<p>Time will tell if this new direction, no responsibility for not only
other developers’ work, but also the Mac and work done by other
developers and flaunted by Apple, will become the norm. After all, Apple
Arcade is an entire Tab of the App Store; inaccessibility is in plain
view. As a counterpoint, the first iPhone software, and even the second
version, was inaccessible to blind people, but now the iPhone is the
most popular smart phone, in developed nations, for blind people.</p>
<p>Perhaps next year, Apple Arcade will have an accessible game or two. I
can only hope that this outcome comes true, and not the steady stepping
back of Apple from one of their founding blocks: accessibility. We
cannot know, as no one at Apple tells us their plans. We aren’t the only
ones, though, as mainstream technology media shows. We must grow
accustom to waiting on Apple to show new things, and reacting
accordingly, but also providing feedback, and pushing back against
encroaching inaccessibility and decay of macOS.</p>
<h2>Apple’s competitors</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I compare operating systems. To me, an operating
system is the root of all software, and thus, the root of all digital
accessibility. With this in mind, the reader may see why it is
imperative that the operating system be as accessible, easy and
delightful to use, and promote productivity as much as possible.
Microsoft and Google are the largest competitors of Apple in the closed
source operating system space, so they are what I will compare Apple to
in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p>Google is the main contributor to the Android and Chromium projects.
While both are open source, both are simply a base to be worked from,
not the end result. Not even Google’s phones run “pure” Android, but
have Google services and probably other things on the phone as well.
Both, though, have varying accessibility as well. While Apple pays great
attention to its mobile operating system’s accessibility, Google does
not seem to put many resources towards that. However, its Chrome OS,
which is used much in education, is much more easily accessible, and
even somewhat of an enjoyable experience for a lite operating system.</p>
<h4>Android</h4>
<p>Android was released one year after iOS. TalkBack was released as part
of Android 1.6. Back then, it only supported navigation via a keyboard,
trackpad, or scroll ball. It wasn’t until version 4 when touch screen
access was implemented into TalkBack for phones, and up to this day,
only supports commands done with one finger, two finger gestures being
passed through to Android as one finger commands. TalkBack has worked
around this issue by recently, in Android version 8, gaining the ability
to use the finger print sensor, if available, as a gesture pad for
setting options, and the ability the switch spoken language, if using
Google TTS, when reading text in more than one language. TalkBack uses
graphical menus for setting options otherwise, or performing actions,
like deleting email. It can be used with a Bluetooth keyboard. By
default, it uses Google TTS, a lower quality, offline version of speech
used for things like Google Translate, Google Maps, and the Google Home.
TalkBack cannot use the higher quality Google TTS voices. Instead,
voices from other vendors are downloaded for more natural sound.</p>
<p>BrailleBack, discussed <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/3535226">on its Google Support
page</a>,
is an accessibility service which, when used with TalkBack running,
provides rudamentary braille support to Android. Commands are rugged,
meaningless, and unfamiliar to users of other screen readers, and
TalkBack’s speech cannot be turned off while using Brailleback, meaning
that, as one person helpfully provided, that one must plug in a pair of
headphones and not wear them, or turn down the phone’s volume, to gain
silent usage of one’s phone using braille. Silent reading is one of
braille’s main selling points, but accessibility, if not given the
resources necessary, can become a host of workarounds. Furthermore,
brailleback must be installed onto the phone, providing another barrier
to entry for many deaf-blind users, so some simply buy iPods for braille
if they wish to use an Android phone for customization or contrarian
reasons, or simply stick with the iPhone as most blind people do.</p>
<p>Now, though, many have moved to a new screen reader created by a Chinese
developer, called Commentary. This screen reader does, however, have the
ability to <a href="https://www.inclusiveandroid.com/content/commentary-screen-reader-decrypts-your-phone-if-you-have-full-encryption-turned">decrypt your
phone</a>
if you have encryption enabled. For braille users,
<a href="https://brltty.app">BRLTTY</a> is used for braille usage. This level of
customization, offset by the level of access which apps have to do
anything they wish to your phone, is an edge that some enjoy living on,
and it does allow things like third-party, and perhaps better screen
readers, text to speech engines, apps for blind people like <a href="https://www.seeingwithsound.com">The
vOICe</a>, which gives blind people
artificial vision, and other gray area apps like emulators, which iOS
will not accept on the App Store. Users who are technically inclined do
tend to thrive on Android, finding workarounds a joy to find and use,
whereas people who are not, or are but do not want to fiddle with apps
to replace first-party apps which do not meet the needs of the user, and
unoptimized settings, find themselves doing more configuring of the
phone than using it.</p>
<p>Third party offerings, like launchers, mail apps, web browsers, file
managers, all have variable accessibility, which can change from version
to version. Therefore, one must navigate the shifting landscape of first
party tools which may sort of be good enough, third party tools which
are accessible enough but may not do everything you need, and tools
which users have found workarounds for using them. Third party speech
synthesizers are also hit or miss, with some not working at all, others,
like Eloquence, being now unsupported, and more, like ESpeak, sounding
unnatural. The only good braille keyboard which is free hasn’t been
updated in years, and Google has not made one of their own.</p>
<p>Because of all this, it is safe to say that Android can be a powerful
tool, but has not attained the focus needed to become a great
accessibility tool as well. Google has begun locking down its operating
system, taking away some things that apps could do before. This may come
to inhibit third party tools which blind people now use to give Android
better accessibility. I feel that it is better to have been on iOS,
where things are locked down much, but you have, at least somewhat, a
clear expectation of fairness on Apple’s part. Android is not a big
income source for Google, so Google does not have to answer to app
developers.</p>
<h4>Chrome OS</h4>
<p>Chrome OS is Google’s desktop operating system, running Chrome as the
browser, with support for running Android apps. Its accessibility has
improved plenty over the years, with ChromeVox gaining many features
which make it a good screen reader. You can <a href="http://www.chromevox.com">read more about
chromeVox</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main successes to ChromeVox is its braille support. It is
normal for most first-party screen readers to support braille nowadays.
When one plugs in a braille display to a Chromebook with ChromeVox
enabled, ChromeVox begins using that display automatically, if it is
supported. The surprise here is that if one plugs it in when ChromeVox
is off, ChromeVox will automatically turn on, and begin using the
display. This is beyond what other screen readers can do. ChromeVox, and
indeed TalkBack, do not yet support scripting, editing punctuation and
pronounciation speech, and do not have “activities” as VoiceOver for iOS
and Mac have, but ChromeVox feels much more polished and ready for use
than TalkBack.</p>
<h3>The future of Google accessibility</h3>
<p>Judging by the past, Google may add a few more features to TalkBack, but
less than Apple adds to iOS. They have much to catch up on, however, as
they have only two years ago added the ability for TalkBack to detect
and switch languages, and use the finger print sensor like VoiceOver’s
rotor. I have not seem much change over the two years since, except
making a mode for tracking focus from a toggle to a mandatory feature. I
suspect that, in time, they will remove the option to disable explore by
touch, if they’ve not already.</p>
<p>With Chrome OS, and Google Chrome in general, I hope that the future
brings better things, now that Microsoft is involved in Chromium
development. It could become even more tied to web standards. Perhaps
ChromeVox will gain better sounding offline voices than Android’s lower
quality Google TTS ones, or gain sounds performed using spacial audio
for deeper immersion.</p>
<h3>Microsoft</h3>
<p>Microsoft makes only one overarching operating system, with changes for
XBox, HoloLens, personal computers, and other types of hardware. Windows
has always been the dominant operating system for general purpose
computing for blind people. It hasn’t always been accessible, and it is
only in recent years that Microsoft have actively turned their attention
to accessibility on Windows and XBox.</p>
<p>Now, Windows’ accessibility increases with each update, and Narrator
becomes a more useful screen reader. I feel that, in a year or so, blind
people may be trained to use Narrator instead of other screen readers on
Windows.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>In the early days of Windows, there were many different screen readers
competing for dominance.
<a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">JAWS</a>, Job
Access with Speech, was the most dominant, with
<a href="https://www.gwmicro.com/Window-Eyes/">Window-Eyes</a>, now abandoned, as
second. They gathered information from the graphics card to describe
what was on the screen. There were no accessibility interfaces back
then.</p>
<p>Years later, when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Active_Accessibility">MSAA</a>,
Microsoft Active Accessibility, was created, Window-Eyes decided to lean
on that, while JAWS continued to use video intercept technology to
gather information. In Windows 2000, Microsoft shipped a basic screen
reader, Narrator. It wasn’t meant to be a full, useful screen reader,
but one made so that a user could set up a more powerful one.</p>
<p>Now, we have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32">UI
Automation</a>,
which is still not a very mature product, as screen readers are still
not using it for everything, like Microsoft Office. GW Micro, makers of
Window-eyes, bonded with AI Squared, producers of the ZoomText
magnifier, which was bought by Freedom Scientific, whom promptly
abandoned Window-eyes. These days, JAWS is being taken on by
<a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a>, Nonvisual Desktop Access, a free and
<em>open source</em> screen reader, and Microsoft’s own Narrator screen reader.</p>
<p>In Windows 8, Microsoft began adding features to Narrator. Now, in
Windows 10, four years later, Narrator has proven itself useful, and in
some situations, helpful in ways that all other screen readers have not
been. For example, one can install, setup, and begin using Windows 10
using Narrator. Narrator is the only self-described screen reader which
can, with little configuration, show formatting not by describing it,
but by changing its speech parameters to “show” formatting by sound. The
only other access technology which does this automatically is
<a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak">Emacspeak</a>, the “complete audio
desktop.” Its braille support must be downloaded and installed, for now,
but is still better than Android’s support. Narrator cannot, however,
use a laptop’s trackpad for navigation. Instead, Microsoft decided to
add such spacial navigation to touchscreens, meaning that a user must
reach up and feel around a large screen, instead of using the level
trackpad as a smaller, more manageable area.</p>
<p>Speaking of support, Microsoft’s support system is better in a few ways.
First, unlike Apple, their feedback system allows more communication
between the community and Microsoft developers. Users can comment on
issues, and developers can ask questions, a bit like on Github. Windows
Insider builds come with announcements by Microsoft with what is new,
changed, fixed, and broken. If anything changes regarding accessibility,
it is in the release notes. Microsoft is vocal about what is new in
accessibility of Windows, in an era when many other companies seem
almost ashamed to mention it in release notes. This is much better than
Apple’s silence on many builds of their beta software, and no notice of
accessibility improvements and features at all. Microsoft’s transparency
is a breath of fresh air to me, as I am much more confident in their
commitment to accessibility for it.</p>
<p>Their commitment, however, doesn’t seem to pervade the whole company.
The Microsoft Rewards program is hard to use for me, and contains
quizzes where answers must be dragged and dropped. This may be fun for
sighted users, but I cannot do them with any level of success, so they
aren’t fun for me at all. Another problem is the quality of speech.
While Apple has superb speech options like Macintalk Alex, Vocalizer, or
the Siri voices, Microsoft’s offline voices sound bored, pause for too
long, and have a robotic buzzing sound as they speak. I think that a
company of Microsoft’s size could invest in better speech technology, or
make their online voices available for download for offline use.
Feedback has been given about this issue, so perhaps the next version of
Windows will have more pleasant speech.</p>
<p>Windows has a few downsides, though. It doesn’t support sound through
its Linux subsystem, meaning I cannot use Emacs, with Emacspeak.
Narrator does not yet report when a program opens, or when a new window
appears, and other visual system events. Many newer Universal Windows
apps can be tricky to navigate, and the Mail app still automatically
expands threads as I arrow to them, which I do not want to happen,
making the mail app annoying to use.</p>
<h3>The future of Microsoft accessibility</h3>
<p>I think that the future of Microsoft, regarding accessibility, is very
bright. They seem dedicated to the cause, seeking feedback much more
aggressively than Apple or Google, and many in the blind community love
giving it to them. Windows will improve further, possibly with Narrator
gaining the ability to play interface sounds in immersive audio using
Windows Sonic for Headphones, braille becoming a deeper, and built in
part of Narrator, and higher quality speech made available for download.
Since Microsoft is also a gaming company, it could work on creating
sound scapes for different activities: browsing the web, writing text,
coding, reading, to aid in focus or creativity. Speech synthesis could
be given even more parameters for speaking even more types of formatting
or interface item types. really, with Microsoft’s attention to feedback,
I feel that their potential is considerable for accessibility. Then
again, it is equally possible that Apple will implement these features,
but they aren’t as inviting as Microsoft when it comes to sharing what
I’d <em>love</em> in an operating system as Microsoft has been, so I now just
report bugs, not giving Apple new ideas.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It may be interesting to note the symmetry of accessibility: Apple’s
phone is the dominant phone, but Microsoft’s Windows platform is the
dominant laptop and desktop system among blind people. Apple’s iPhone is
more accessible than Google’s Android, but Google’s Chrome OS is more
polished and updated accessibility-wise than Apple’s MacOS. Personally,
I use a Mac because of its integration with iOS Notes, Messages, Mail,
and other services, the Mail app is a joy to breeze through email with,
and open source tools like Emacs with Emacspeak do not work as well on
Windows. Also, speech matters to me, and I’d probably fall asleep much
more often hearing Microsoft’s buzzing voices than the somewhat
energetic sound of Alex on the Mac, who speaks professionally, calmly,
and never gets bored. I do, however, use Windows for heavy usage of the
web, especially Google web apps and services, and gaming.</p>
<p>Time will tell if companies continue in their paths, Apple forging
ahead, Microsoft burning bright, and Google… being Google. I hope,
nevertheless, that this article has been useful for the reader, and that
my opinions have been as fair as possible towards the companies. It
should be noted that the accessibility teams for each company are
individuals, have their own ideas of what accessibility is, means, and
should be, and should be treated with care. After all, this past decade
has been a long journey of, probably, most effort spent convincing
managers that the features we now have are worth spending time on, and
answering user complaints of “my phone is talking to me and i want it
turned off right now!”.</p>
<p>This does not excuse them for the decay of Android and Mac
accessibility, and the lack of great speech options on Windows. It does
not excuse them for Apple Arcade’s lack of accessible games, or
Microsoft Rewards’ inaccessible quizzes. We must give honest, complete,
and critical feedback to these people. After all, they do not know what
we need, what will be useful, or, if we dare tell, what will be
delightful for us to use, unless we give them this feedback. This
applies to all software, whether it be Apple’s silent gathering of
feedback, Microsoft’s open arms and inviting offers, or open source
software’s issue trackers, Discord servers, mailing lists, and Github
repositories. If we want improvement, we must ask for it. If we want a
better future, we must make ourselves heard in the present. Let us all
remember the past, so that we can influence the future.</p>
<p>Now, what do you think of all this? Do you believe Apple will continue
to march ahead regarding accessibility, or do you think that Microsoft,
or even Google, has something bigger planned? Do you think that Apple is
justified in their silence, or do you hope that they begin speaking more
openly about their progress, at least in release notes? Do you like how
open Microsoft is about accessibility, or do they even talk about
accessibility for blind users enough to you? I’d love to know your
comments, corrections, and constructive criticism, either in the
comments, on Twitter, or anywhere else you can find me. Thanks so much
for reading!</p>
