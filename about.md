My name is Devin Prater. I’m a 25 year old technical assistant,
Christian, gamer,
accessibility advocate, blind person, Science Fiction and Fantasy
reader, and computer aficionado.

## About this blog

This blog will contain my musings on subjects as varied as
accessibility, blindness, open source, Apple, Microsoft, screen
readers, Emacs, Emacspeak, Christianity, emulation, and just about
anything else. I plan to cover plenty, much of which doesn’t really
seem to be talked about anywhere else. I know, that’s what everyone
else says, but perhaps my writings will prove me right, or they may
not.
