I"5<p>In a <a href="2020-02-13-accessibility-consistency.md">previous blog post</a>, I
talked about Apple having a few problems to fix. Last month, they
fixed one of them, being Apple Research. The hearing study now will
have accessible hearing tests and questions. Focus is still a little
jumpy in the Heart and Movement study questions, and my watch screen
has become a moving part so I can’t participate in that study
completely, or track my sleep accurately, but getting transportation
to the Apple Store is something I’ve covered well on Twitter already.</p>
