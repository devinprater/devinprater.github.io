I"°<h1 id="about-the-blogger">About the blogger</h1>

<p>My name is Devin Prater. Iâ€™m a 25 year old technical assistant,
Christian, gamer, accessibility advocate, blind person, Science
Fiction and Fantasy reader, and computer aficionado. I come from the
state of Alabama, where things move slow and thereâ€™s cornbread and
chicken, and football is the sport. Iâ€™d much rather eat something
quick and simple, and read, than watch sports and go places.</p>

<h1 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h1>

<p>This blog will contain my musings on subjects as varied as
accessibility, blindness, open source, Apple, Microsoft, screen
readers, Emacs, Emacspeak, Christianity, emulation, copyright, and
just about anything else. I plan to cover plenty, much of which
doesnâ€™t really seem to be talked about anywhere else. I know, thatâ€™s
what everyone else says, but perhaps my writings will prove me right,
or they may not.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to contribute, please make a pull request to the <a href="http://github.com/devinprater/devinprater.github.io">Github
repository</a>. This
can include guest posts, article corrections, and fixes to the HTML,
Javascript, or CSS that makes the blog work. Contributions are always
welcome.</p>

<p>Please note that when I speak of accessibility, I am speaking from the
perspective of a totally blind person with some light perception.
Because I cannot live the experiences of a person with some vision,
deafness, Autism, paralysis, or cognitive disabilities, I will rarely
mention accessibility in regards to those disabilities. This is not to
demean these groups, I simply do not know enough to comment or have an
opinion.</p>
