I"è<p>In this post, I‚Äôll detail my experiences of advocating for
accessibility in open source software, why it is important, and how
others can help. I‚Äôve not been doing it for long, but at least now,
I‚Äôve done a bit. I‚Äôll also touch upon why I think open source
software, on all operating systems, is important, and what closed
source and closed feedback systems cannot offer, which open source
grants. On the other hand, there are things which closed source
somewhat grants, but which has faltered slightly in recent days. I
will attempt to denote what is fact and what is opinion, this goes for
any post of a commentary of informative nature.</p>
