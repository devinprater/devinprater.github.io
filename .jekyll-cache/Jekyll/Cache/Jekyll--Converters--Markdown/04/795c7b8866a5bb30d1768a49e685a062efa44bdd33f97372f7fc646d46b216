I"r<p>Earlier this year, my Airpods Pro began making a clicking sound, when
in Noise Cancellation or transparency mode. I didn’t think much of it,
and just used them regularly, until sound began distorting after a
while of listening. I’ve simply stopped using them, as I shudder to
think how much a cab ride to the nearest Apple Store, potentially an
hour away, would cost. This is only one problem with the Apple
ecosystem: being locked into Apple’s wireless headphones, other
Bluetooth headphones, or other workarounds, and Apple Stores being far
away, which is what I’ll be focusing on in this article. I will show,
in the following paragraphs, how Apple’s handling of its ecosystem
effects the hardware and software regarding accessibility matters.
These matters may effect some in the general population, but people
with disabilities are effected much more acutely.</p>
