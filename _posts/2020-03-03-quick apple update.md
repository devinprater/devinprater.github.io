In a [previous blog post]({% link
_posts/2020-02-13-accessibility-consistency.md %}), I
talked about Apple having a few problems to fix. Last month, they
fixed one of them, being Apple Research. The hearing study now will
have accessible hearing tests and questions. Focus is still a little
jumpy in the Heart and Movement study questions, and my watch screen
has become a moving part so I can’t participate in that study
completely, or track my sleep accurately, but getting transportation
to the Apple Store is something I’ve covered well on Twitter already.

So, thanks so much to the people at Apple who handled the Research
accessibility to this point, and may it become even better, reversing
the trend started with the inaccessibility of Apple Arcade.
