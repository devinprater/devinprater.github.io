This article will be something rather different from my normal
postings. I’ve decided to begin doing news posts, rather than just my
ramblings. Oh, there will still be rambles, as I have an opinion on
everything, and readers might as well know the person I am, to
understand more about my viewpoint, to gauge the content relative to
the content writer.

The scope of the news will vary, but I expect it to be mostly open
source stuff relevant to the blind community. This may change, as
readers may always contact me requesting that I write articles or news
items about subjects. I will let the folks at Blind Bargains chase
after Humanware, Vispero, HIMS, and other such “big names” in the
Assistive Technology world. I seek for my content to be different,
meaningful, and lacking the comedic nature of more popular news sites
for the blind. Yes, I do have a slight grudge against larger sites who
can dictate, pretty well without fail, what readers know about. After
all, if a blind person only listens to the Blind Bargains podcast,
will they know about these advancements, like retroarch, Stormux, and
so on? In any case, with that out of the way, let’s be on with the
news.

# GTK 4 could be more accessible

This year, folks from GTK met with some accessibility advocates. They
came up with [this
roadmap](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/02/17/gtk-hackfest-2020-roadmap-and-accessibility/)
for better accessibility. GTK is the way some Linux apps are given
graphical representations, like buttons, check boxes, and so on. As I
always say, the operating system is the root of accessibility, and the
stronger that root is, the more enjoyable it will be. I hope that this
will bring much more accessibility to Linux.

# Mate 1.24 brings greater accessibility

Last month, Mate released [version 1.24](https://mate-desktop.org/blog/2020-02-10-mate-1-24-released/) of its desktop environment,
which is basically like a version of the Windows desktop, handling the
start menu, task bar, and other such aspects of a graphical interface.
Mate uses a system more like Windows XP, while other desktops, like
Gnome, are more new in their approaches.

Just search for “accessibility” on the linked page, and you’ll find
quite a few improvements. This is a great sign; I really like it when
organizations, or companies, display their accessibility commitment
proudly in updates, and not just the bland “bug fixes and performance
improvements” mantra tiredly used in most change logs today.

After the quiet death of F123, # Stormux: a distribution which might stick around
