<p>Text formatting is used in many areas, from books, newspapers,
articles, websites, and documents. Paragraphs, headings, lists,
italics, bold, and many other characteristics are used to emphasize,
denote chapters, and mark changes in scenes or actions. Sighted users
can use formatting to find points of interest in text. What about
people who are blind? Is formatting effective for us? Can it be
useful?</p>
<p>In this article, I will explore text formatting, and how blind people
use it or dismiss it. Like all of my other articles, this one will
contain opinions. This area is one that I feel should be discussed,
however, because it is an area of inclusion that I feel blind people
have ignored, and sighted people haven’t generally approached.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Text formatting is pretty much just information about text to a
computer. A bolded word, an italicized title, a heading line, or a
list of items are all ways of formatting. Sighted people see all this
in the context of their chosen font, but screen readers only read, by
default, a small set of textual attributes, and only by describing
what the attribute is.</p>
<p>If a screen reader user turns on the reading of styles or formatting,
the screen reader will, italics on describe italics off, the
formatting, which can become verbose, and sometimes doesn’t help
because the screen reader doesn’t pause after speaking formatting
characteristics, meaning that the user has to quickly parse what the
screen reader is saying.</p>
<p>So, is that it? Is the only choice for a user to hear little to no
formatting information, or hear it all in a quick procession of words?
There are other options, better in fact than anything done by most
visual interfaces so far.</p>
<h2>How blind people format text</h2>
<p>Blind people have a few ways of formatting text. The visual method
requires users to press a command, write their text, press the command
again, and review formatting with the screen reader. Braille allows
blind people to feel formatting, if supported by the screen reader.
Markup languages allow blind people to type formatting symbols around
text, which they can review with normal text navigation functions.</p>
<h3>Visual</h3>
<p>The most popular way of formatting for sighted users, choosing a
formatting attribute from a tool bar, is also how blind people format,
most of the time, using keyboard commands. It is easy because it is
familiar. All word processors support this, using similar keyboard
commands for bold, italics, underline, and indentation. Some word
processors, like LibreOffice on Windows, do not speak when these
keyboard commands are pressed, so users have to trust in their
keyboarding.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that one has to turn on the reading
of font information, like styles, for a screen reader user to be sure
when a particular formatting style begins and ends, and that a program
may not speak when formatting commands are pressed. Screen readers do,
usually, read headings and lists without needing settings changes, but
that’s about all. JAWS for Windows can be configured to <a href="https://doccenter.freedomscientific.com/doccenter/doccenter/rs25c51746a0cc/2012-06-20_TextFormatting/02_TextFormatting.htm">speak or play
sounds</a>
for formatting, but most users do not realize that this feature is
available, and so it is not used.</p>
<p>Not all is lost, however. Narrator now has the ability to read
formatting using different speech settings, like a change in pitch,
volume, or rate. VoiceOver on the Mac can "beep" for formatting
changes, although that doesn’t tell us <em>which</em> formatting information
was used. NVDA has begun working on refactoring its speech system, so
in the future, NVDA may be able to do what Narrator does, and more.
Imagine hearing sounds for each text attribute, instead of even having
vocal indications.</p>
<h3>Braille</h3>
<p>Braille is a tactile way of reading, and has plenty of standards for
showing formatting. If you get a book from a library in braille, it is
likely to have been formatted very well. Reading braille via screen
reader, however, is often a bland experience, with little to no
formatting information. Screen readers do show abbreviated symbols for
item types like headings, lists, and links, but not italics, bold,
underline, or anything else. One can use Status Cells, dots at the end
of a display used in a few screen readers to show text attributes, but
these are imprecise, as a formatted word would show, on that status
cell, as if the whole line were formatted. iOS uses this technique.
The largest problem with this is that there are standard braille
symbols for formatting, supported by the
<a href="http://liblouis.org">Liblouis</a> translator at least; they simply
aren’t used. In Safari, formatted text is often placed in its own
item, but that still doesn’t tell us <em>which</em> text attribute was used.</p>
<p>The only screen reader that currently shows any text formatting is
NVDA. It can show emphasized text, but that’s all I’ve found. It used
to show more, and why it doesn’t now I don’t know. The Braille
Extender addon adds the ability for NVDA to show paragraph
indentation. All other screen readers just show words, just like
speech, without any trace of formatting.</p>
<h3>Text Markup</h3>
<p>Text markup languages, like <a href="https://commonmark.org">Markdown</a>,
<a href="https://orgmode.org">Org-mode</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> allow the user to write a
document, web page, blog post, or book using formatting that anyone
can read. Screen readers may need to be set to speak most punctuation,
and in the case of Markdown and Org-mode, set to repeat more than
three characters. This is even used in contexts where it is not
supported, like Email, forum posts, and texts.</p>
<p>This type of formatting, for now, is the most accessible. It can be
read using speech or braille, and can often be previewed in a browser
or other format if a user isn’t confident in using the markup style.
Because of this level of accessibility, I believe that Markdown, or
even better, Org-mode, should be a part of text editing, everywhere,
in all operating systems. A user could write in Markdown, and the text
would visually be formatted, allowing all those *italics* to not go
to waste. If you use Emacs with
<a href="http://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/">Emacspeak</a>, you hear formatting
when reading websites, Markdown and Org-mode files, and syntax
highlighting with source code.</p>
<h2>Why blind people dismiss formatting</h2>
<p>If you are sighted, imagine a world with no formatting. No italics, no
bold, no underline, just some headings, lists, and block quotes, all
practically the same, and absolutely no color. This is, even using
braille display, what blind people get. There aren’t even any separate
paragraphs, just chunks of text on mobile and Mac, and one long page
with some headings for division on Windows. Would you enjoy this?</p>
<p>If you are blind, you already know this world, and probably don’t
consider the possibility that at least one word on this page is
italicized, because for you, there is no formatting; it simply doesn’t
exist. Blind people don’t particularly like formatting because we
can’t really use it on the most popular system, Windows, with the most
popular screen readers, NVDA and JAWS, without much frustration. We
don’t dismiss it because we  don’t like the idea, we dismiss it
because we don’t have access to that information, and don’t see the
uses for it.</p>
<h2>How formatting can be useful</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the obvious. Headings can mark chapters of a book,
sections of an article, and allow quick navigation through a page for
blind people. Lists are useful for itemizing content. Block quotes
are useful for long quotations.</p>
<p>What about the more invisible formatting, at least for blind people?
Italics is great for <em>emphasizing</em> things, bold makes things stand
out, and underlining is good for making something notable. If screen
readers spoke these things using differing speech parameters, or even
sounds, I’m sure that most blind people would find that they add some
color to our Grey, lifeless text, and make things we write look much
better to sighted readers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What do you think, reader? Do you care about formatting enough to use
<a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> on just about every Word document, like
me, in order to see formatting? Would you rather not know about
formatting on your favorite websites? If you can see, do you not
really notice formatting, or do you find it essential and beautiful?
Please, let me know. I’d love to hear your feedback, whether it come
through Email, Twitter, or even a contribution to my blog’s <a href="https://github.com/devinprater/devinprater.github.io">Github
repository</a>.
Again, thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Have you ever downloaded a file that you didn’t have permission to
get? I have, many times in the past. This post, about copyright issues
faced by blind people, may spark much debate in our community, but I
feel that it must be written. It will cover games, books, films, and
software which blind people copy, the justifications for doing so, and
the harm that it can cause.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It was said, about 50 years ago, that some 70 percent of blind people
are unemployed. That fact, as overused as it is, is the number that
appears to be the most up-to-date data easily found. My experience is
that, indeed, many blind people are still unemployed. This correlates
well with illegal copying of files which will be discussed in this
article.</p>
<p>As usual with articles I write, I’ll start with defining terms. I call
the downloading or sharing of files which the user doesn’t have the
right to do so “illegal sharing,” “filesharing,” or “illegal copying.”
Most people just call it “piracy,” or “online piracy,” which I find is
more of a scare tactic and an attempt to put all the blame on the
sharer to further dramatize the alleged crime.</p>
<p>Blind people are in a unique position regarding filesharing. All of
our digital entertainment and livelihood is digital data, whether it
be books, music, movies, or programs. This can be true for sighted
people as well, but we’ll get to why blind people are more likely to
illegally download later in this article.</p>
<p>As for me, I have illegally downloaded plenty of material in my
teenage years. Now that I have a job and good income, I can afford to
buy whatever is available to me, but I write this article remembering
when I could not buy, and the people who still do not have the money,
or inclination, to buy digital material.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>Many people like playing games, and this is true for blind people as
well. Before we got computers, I remember playing Uno  as a child at the
school for the blind I grew up in. When we did get computers, however,
I did begin playing games created specifically for blind people,
called <a href="https://audiogames.net">Audio Games</a>.</p>
<p>I remember downloading one game in particular, and because I had no
money, cracking it, meaning that the game was made a full version
instead of a demo, without purchasing an activation key. I spent many
afternoons after school on that game, and eventually getting into
others. Now, I rarely play audio games, focusing on video games
instead, which I find, personally, provide more enjoyment.</p>
<p>Video games, however, are also not safe from illegal copying. I’ve
downloaded many video games, new and old, without purchasing them.
From Mortal Kombat to Skullgirls, I’ve downloaded many video games
when audio ones weren’t enough. I no longer have the illegally
downloaded copies.</p>
<p>I, however, am not the only one. Recently, the audio games forum has
<a href="https://forum.audiogames.net/topic/29249/preparation-regarding-copyright/">begun inforcing
rules</a>
about linking to illegal sharing sites or files, and there has been
some backlash and discontent regarding such a policy. Users have
threatened to leave, site addresses have been censored, and
filesharing has most likely been pushed even further into private or
less formal locations. However, there are those less formal locations
for such a reason, away from a public forum.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>Reading is something that blind people have enjoyed, with
independence, ever since the adoption of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille">braille</a>. Reading became even
more widespread with the introduction of audio books, chiefly lead by
the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/overview/">National Library
Service</a> (NLS), which
basically gives blind and print disabled people free braille or audio
books. The downloadable audio books are protected by a special key
delivered by the NLS server, so one cannot simply listen to the book
outside of NLS’ apps. This service, however, has not proven to be
enough for some readers.</p>
<p>There are many ways for a person to consume the written word, and many
devices to do it on. The NLS BARD (Braille and Audio Reading Download)
app is only available on iOS and Android mobile devices, and perhaps
can also be made to work on Chromebooks using the Android app. This
means that if a user prefers to listen to books while on a computer,
he or she will need to find a book from elsewhere without restrictions
on usage. The NLS also may not have a reader’s favorite narrator.
Audible books, however, are quite expensive, leaving the user to
illegally share that book. Readers may also want to simply read a book
on their computer using a screen reader. If one does not have a
subscription to <a href="https://www.bookshare.org/">Bookshare</a>, then Epub
books must also be illegally downloaded if the reader does not have
the money to buy them.</p>
<p>There is also a great service called <a href="https://www.graphicaudio.net">Graphic
Audio</a>, which creates a dramatized audio
play of books, with a full cast, sound and music, and abridgment of
some nonessential scenes. These titles can be very entertaining, but
are also costly if one wants to listen to an entire series. On the
other hand, they also have frequent discounts up to 40%, so one can
take advantage of those. Even then, these titles often are illegally shared as well.</p>
<h2>Films</h2>
<p>Many blind people do watch television and movies, although I usually
do not. I have done so in the past, however, and remember getting
plenty of films’ audio files with descriptions of visual content
added. This “described” television is very popular with completely
blind people, who want to participate in today’s culture.</p>
<p>There are a few sites online today which provide no video content, but
simply audio files containing the film’s audio track, with the
described content added on. These provide the same level of access
that a DVD would that contains description, but with a much smaller
file size. I thought nothing, during my teenage years, of sharing this
to friends simply by copying a folder full of described content onto
flash drives, and the same is done over the Internet today.</p>
<p>Streaming content subscriptions have become today’s Cable
subscriptions, and many blind people have simply signed up for one or
two of those. Almost all of them provide at least some description in
their content, and Apple TV Plus has provided it since its launch last
year. However, some blind people still share this content with
descriptions, in order to not pay a monthly subscription along with
more essential needs.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Blind people may not be the majority of software filesharers, but
sighted people have not, in the past, needed to pay $10,99 for a
software package to access their screen. Indeed, while free options,
like <a href="http://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a>, are gaining in ability and
popularity, <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">JAWS for
Windows</a> is
still more customizable. In the last year, Freedom Scientific has
offered a subscription plan: JAWS and updates for $100 per year, but
they still cannot compete with free, which continues to net NVDA more
users. Now, however, more and more blind people are able to do what
they need on mobile devices, which include a screen reader out of the
box.</p>
<p>I’ve said on some occasions that Text-to-speech voices are for blind
people what fonts are for sighted users. We may like different voices
for different contexts, and there isn’t one voice that clearly beats
any competition. Many voices that we use now sound more natural, but
do not quite have the rhythm and intonation of speech correct. Older
voices may sound more robotic, but also more smooth, and even if a
word is mispronounced, it is pronounced the same way every time. One
of these older, and more popular, speech engines is
<a href="https://codefactoryglobal.com/app-store/eloquence-for-windows/">Eloquence</a>.
Some blind people do not like it, but many others do. There is only
one problem: it hasn’t been updated since the early 2000’s.</p>
<p>Eloquence is known most for being the voice that JAWS has used for
many years. It was also used in Window-Eyes and many other screen
readers, and is also usable on Linux and was recently abandoned on
Android. Years ago, Nuance, the owners of the popular Vocalizer
voices, bought Eloquence, but have done nothing to update ot, or offer
it directly to customers. A few companies have tried to offer legal
versions, but the one I was gifted, a version which works <a href="https://www.atguys.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=231">directly
with
NVDA</a>,
does not work even as well as unofficial, illegally shared versions.
In fact, after a restructure of NVDA broke compatibility with the
legal version, an unofficial version was made to work before a new
version of codeFactory’s was released.</p>
<p>Blind people may even fileshare entire operating systems. In order to
experience Apple’s MacOS operating system without having to buy a Mac
or get a taxi to the nearest Apple Store, users download a virtual
machine containing MacOS to try, or even use long term, on a Windows
computer. This may extend a user’s access to services which may be
inaccessible or hard to use on Windows.</p>
<h2>Justifications of Filesharing</h2>
<p>Many blind people are poor. We look for jobs, but some people can’t
find one that they are confident in doing no matter what. Family
members may hold young adults back from looking for a job for
overbearing reasons. Government agencies may not respond to calls for
help, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are unlikely to hire
just any blind person, no matter the few success stories.</p>
<p>This means that blind people do not have the money to buy products, or
if they receive supplemental income, they, or their parents, use it
for food, rent, and other necessities. Of course, this simply means
that more jobs must become accessible to blind people, and government
organizations should implement more outreach to people with
disabilities who seek employment. This does not mean that the
government should pay for a blind person’s entertainment and digital
access, however. I believe that people with disabilities need jobs,
not more government money.</p>
<p>Blind people may feel that, because they do not have a job, and aren’t
likely to get one, that because filesharing is possible and easy, they
are entitled to get content. These people may illegally download
material, even if they have extra income as well, as they feel
entitled to it. They don’t usually hang out in public forums,
preferring more private areas of the Internet.</p>
<p>Some content may not be available for purchase. This includes games
which must be emulated to provide accessibility. I, for example, love
playing dissidia Final Fantasy. This game can be made accessible using
OCR technology which finds text in graphical content like games, and
is built into most screen readers. I can read the menus, battle
information, and unspoken character dialog, but only on a computer, as
the Playstation Portable didn’t have any accessibility tools. I worked
around this by buying the game on the Playstation Network store, then
downloading the game file from elsewhere, as the PSN store doesn’t
allow downloading the purchased PSP game.</p>
<p>This will become harder to work around, however, as older games may
become accessible using other methods. For example, where would one
legally purchase a digital copy of a Super Nintendo, Sega Megadrive,
or Gameboy game? Emulation, in this case, is used to add accessibility
to a game, and not for the express purpose of simply having a free
game. Most gamers, however, just download the game files, ROM’s,
without regard to buying it. Many developers may not mind users
downloading 8 or more year old games.</p>
<h2>The harm of illegal downloading</h2>
<p>What if you wrote a book, and sold it, but months later it was sold
using slightly different names? That is what happened to a few
developers of audio games. Called “clones,” these games used the same
programming, but slightly different music and names for items.</p>
<p>I believe that filesharing can lead a community to other, more
noticeable problems later on, including cloning. If people do not
think that they should have to pay for things which entertain them,
they may find other things acceptable too. This may not effect those
who are simply too poor to pay for content, or those who try to
ethically fileshare, but will effect those who feel entitled to
content.</p>
<p>Filesharing may also drive away mainstream developers from public
forums. As mentioned on the audio games forum, if mainstream
developers of video games see that we illegally copy books and movies, they
may wish to not lose sales of their own games to the filesharers of
our community.</p>
<p>A third problem with illegally downloading deals with developers in
our own community. If they do not make money, they may not feel that
developing general programs like book reader apps, or games for us
isn’t worth it, so we may have one less accessible program to use.
This isn’t to say that all software created by blind developers is
worth it; some games and apps are pretty awful. I do say, however,
that we should always reward good creativity, and that goes for all
creators of content and programs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, I have discussed the controversial topic of
filesharing among blind people. We illegally copy just about any type
of content available, although music subscription services have made
filesharing music not as prevalent. There are justifications that
people may make, and harmful effects that the community should be
aware of.</p>
<p>So, my readers, what are your thoughts? Do you fileshare your way
through books, films, and software? Do you have enough money to spend
on entertainment and software you need? Do you feel that you shouldn’t
have to buy software and media? Please, let me know your thoughts,
anywhere you can submit them. I’m always eager for feedback on the
articles I write. Thanks again for reading them!</p>
<p>Also, if anyone has ideas or articles they’d like me to host, please
feel free to let me know. I will seriously consider all suggestions
for topics to write about.</p>

<p>What if all of your software were free, like NVDA? What if the only
thing asked of you by software makers was to donate or contribute? How
would this effect your life, and the lives of developers? In this
article, I will explain what open source is, what it is currently used
for, my experiences with it, and how you can make it better.</p>
<h2>What is Open Source?</h2>
<p>Open source is a splinter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">Free Software
movement</a>. The
Free Software movement believes that everyone should be able to view a
program's code, and modify it if needed. The thing which sets open
source apart is that it doesn't mind working with companies which create
closed source, or proprietary, software which cannot be modified or have
its source code seen by the user.</p>
<p>When free and open source spokespeople talk about freedom, they mean
free as in free speech, not as in free things. This talk of freedom
upsets business, so the term "open source" is used instead. Much open
source software is free of cost, with the developers asking for donation
instead of demanding payment.</p>
<h2>What is Open Source used for?</h2>
<p>Open source software is just about everywhere, and often comes with a
tightly knit community of users. Examples of open source in the blind
community include <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/">NVDA</a>,
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca">Orca Screen
Reader</a>, <a href="https://brailleblaster.org">Braille
Blaster</a>, <a href="http://liblouis.org">Liblouis</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak">Emacspeak</a>. Examples of
closed source include <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">JAWS for Windows</a>, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17173/windows-10-hear-text-read-aloud">Narrator</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision/">VoiceOver</a>, the latest
version of
<a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en">TalkBack</a>,
<a href="https://duxburysystems.com">Duxberry Braille translator</a>, iOS, Windows, and plenty of apps you may have on
your iPhone or Android phone.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some projects are a mixture of both. JAWS incorporates
Liblouis for braille translation, and so do Narrator and VoiceOver.
Apple uses plenty of open source tools: Python, command line shells, and
many command line tools on MacOS. Microsoft makes BRLTTY and Liblouis
available for download to interface with Narrator.</p>
<p>Linux, which founded many offshoots, is an entire operating system built
on open source ideals. Blind people began customizing Linux for use with
speech, and work is ongoing to make Linux an accessible operating
system. This began with <a href="https://wiki.vinuxproject.org">Vinux</a>. It
started up talking, something no other system had done before. One could
use it with speech or braille, and used the eSpeak voices.</p>
<p>That operating system, or distribution of Linux as they are called, is
now abandoned, not having been updated in years. Another project, <a href="https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=sonar">Sonar
Gnu Linux</a>, also
came and went. It was based on Arch Linux, and was my favorite
distribution. People now use <a href="https://talkingarch.info/download.html">Talking
Arch</a>, or
<a href="https://tarch.org">Tarch</a>, if they are adventurous and <a href="https://slint.fr/wiki/doku.php?id=en:installation">Slint
Linux</a> if they
aren't. These are the most popular Linux distributions for those who are
blind. If I've missed anything, let me know. Some distributions which
were not made for the blind are also accessible.
<a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a>, <a href="https://trisquel.info">Trisquel</a>,
<a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, and <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> are
also able to be installed, but the user must know the correct keyboard
command to turn on the screen reader.</p>
<p>Most open source software can be found on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>.
That's where NVDA, Orca, and many other tools, even for the blind, are.
But how reliable are these tools? What about the operating system? Could
one get rid of Windows with this software founded on ideals?</p>
<h2>My experiences with Open Source</h2>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Accessibility is a software issue, so the root of software, the
operating system, will make or break any accessibility. My experiences
with Linux began, mainly, with an old operating system called
<a href="https://wiki.vinuxproject.org">Vinux</a>. I didn't stick with it for long,
and soon forgot about it, and it is now abandoned. Linux can run many
different desktops, which give users the major system functions of
accessing apps and system utilities. Gnome and Mate are accessible, just
about everything else, for now, including KDE, isn't. Vinux used Gnome
2, which is basically what Mate is now.</p>
<p>I came back to Linux for a short while with Sonar. I really liked it,
but missed the games and speech options Windows had. I liked all the
software that we have access to on Windows, and browsing the Internet
with Linux wasn't that good back then. I soon got into the Apple
ecosystem with an iPhone and such, and already had a Mac for quite a
while. Still, Linux called to me.</p>
<p>I'm never satisfied with the workflow I have. I always want to be more
efficient, more quick, more capable in what I do. I always want better
sound, even if 3D effects and virtual surround sound aren't actually
necessary or real. Like a sighted person wants great graphics, I want
great sound. On Linux, there is a way to enable virtual surround sound,
but it offers little reward, and much configuration, crackling in audio,
and doesn't augment stereo audio as options on other systems does. The
Mac has a third-party option, <a href="https://www.globaldelight.com/boom/">Boom
3D</a>, and Windows has <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-windows-sonic-windows-10-creators-update">Windows Sonic
for
Headphones</a>.
Both of these require nearly no configuration, augments much more audio,
and only Boom 3D causes a bit of sluggishness.</p>
<p>I also want a faster way of doing things. Many keyboard shortcuts,
letter navigation of items in lists and menus, and ways of only getting
the information I want. I have much of this on the Mac, with the Mail
app allowing me, through table navigation, to speed through subjects
instead of having to hear the row titles and contents and all before
what I really want to hear, and being able to go to the previous or next
message in a thread without needing to close the window. Linux has some
of this, but many times things are unclear, with Orca, the Linux screen
reader, just speaking the items, and not what type of item it is. This
is clear in the area of Audacious settings where you choose sound
effects.</p>
<p>Even so, Linux has such an appeal to me. I have tried Fedora Linux,
<a href="https://slint.fr/wiki/doku.php?id=:en:start">Slint</a>, Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, and found that there is always something
missing. Accessibility isn't that good in the graphical interface, and
much still takes a lot of configuring and asking the community. And I
really hate asking for help.</p>
<p>Recently, the <a href="https://mate-desktop.org">Mate desktop</a> team has
released a version with accessibility fixes. This is important, as
many companies, like app developers, Apple, and Google, rarely share
that there are accessibility fixes in minor updates, and don't even
share all the new features in major releases. This gives me some hope
that the open source community at large just needs more blind people
telling them about our needs. Then again, this is probably just
another of my excuses to bash my head against the hardened wall of
Linux, yet again. Plus, everything in the open source moves slowly,
and this is doubly true for open source assistive technology.</p>
<p>There are, however, blind people who use Linux, just as there are some
in the blind community who use Android. In fact, there is an entire
<a href="https://linux-a11y.org">Linux Accessibility Site</a>. However, the site
does have links to abandoned software, and doesn't link to all
accessibility initiatives, like <a href="https://stormux.org">Stormux</a>. Both
Linux-a11y and Stormux ask for donations, so there is also duplicated
effort and decentralization even in the blind Linux user community.</p>
<p>Now, I use a Mac. It contains enough open source technology to support
<a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package
manager</a>. I can run
Emacs, with Emacspeak on it, along with just about any command line
program I'd use on Linux. The Mac's graphical interface is good enough
for mail and some web browsing, just not so good with Google Docs, and I
can probably do anything on it that a Linux user can do.</p>
<p>And yet, sometimes, Linux calls to me still. VoiceOver isn't the best
screen reader out there, and Linux has the appeal of being run by
people, not corporations. And yet, looking at the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/accessibility/accessibility.en.html">GNU accessibility
statement</a>,
you'd think it was updated in 2006 or so. It may have been, which is a
slap in the face for any accessibility advocate. The GNU project, with
this statement, says to us that we're only worth putting up a quick
page, detailing the inaccessibility of old technologies and not
maintaining it. It tells us that we're a good poster to hang up in their
trophy room of "people aided by our courageous stand for the minorities
who desperately need our help," but then discarded for the "community"
to handle. After all, the GNU don't know anything about helping the
blind, do they? Can the GNU be expected to enforce accessibility among
their projects? Doesn't the government take care of the poor blind
people? Blind people have their Vinux and Sonar, why not just use those?
No, that is definitely not segregation, not at all!</p>
<h3>Open Source Programs</h3>
<p>I began using NVDA around high school. No one had ever heard of it at
that point, in a day when people called all screen readers either "JAWS"
or "Microsoft." I've not stopped using it ever sense. Its features have
grown, its users growing even faster. It now has a community of
programmers, translators, and writers. It is, in my opinion, the most
versatile Windows screen reader. JAWS still works okay for some things,
like malformed spreadsheets, but for everything else on Windows, I use
NVDA.</p>
<p>Braille Blaster is also a great project, making braille translation,
embossing, and transcription free. I use it for translating EBooks into
good, formatted braille files for reading on my iPhone using the BARD
Mobile app. Now, I don't even use Duxberry, even though it is provided
on my work computer.</p>
<p>I've found that open source programs, built upon closed source operating
systems, are the best compromise. NVDA, BrailleBlaster, TDSR, and many
other tools built for the blind community run on Windows or Mac. Having
a great foundation in accessibility makes all the difference for users.</p>
<h2>How can You help?</h2>
<p>Github, as stated earlier, is a hub of open source projects. One great
thing about the service is that anyone can contribute. Just make an
account, and you're ready to help.</p>
<p>If you can program, you can <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">collaborate by modifying
code</a>.
If you try the software and find accessibility problems, you can tell
developers about <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue">bugs or
features</a>
that need fixing or adding. If you find a project you like, they may
have a Patreon to which you can donate, or you can simply spread the
word.</p>
<p>One large project which has become accessible through efforts of the
blind reaching out is Retroarch. An issue was created asking for
accessibility, and it was released in the very next version, and even
more work is being done to make even more games accessible. Open source
collaboration is great for even more than just programming. See projects
I'm working on, all text, on <a href="https://devinprater.github.io/about/">the About page of my original
blog</a>.</p>
<p>Another bit of news is that GTK, a way for programs to be displayed
and written, has had a
<a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/02/17/gtk-hackfest-2020-roadmap-and-accessibility/">Hackfest</a>,
where accessibility was extensively discussed. It is hoped that this means
that accessibility will become a larger issue in Linux, and that blind
people will one day be able to use Linux as confidently as they use
Windows and Mac now.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As time goes by, I find myself drawn to open source. its promise of a
better way of making software, the community of helpful people, and the
freedom give me hope. While the Linux operating system does not come
close to satisfying the hope I have for accessibility, programs and
initiatives on top of Windows and Mac have thrived. While the poor
accessibility statement of the GNU project shows that the community at
large does not yet care much about accessibility, the community of blind
people working for our own future, rather than that of a corporation,
gives me hope of a bright future of digital accessibility for blind
people.</p>
<p>What do you think, reader? Does open source call to you as well? Do you
just use whatever system you're given? Have you made peace with Linux's
shortcomings around accessibility? Please, let me know. I am glad to
receive feedback. If you'd like, you may even suggest, via email or
Twitter, articles for which you feel passionate about that need
coverage. I will consider all that you send me, and thank you for
reading.</p>

<p>This article will explore Apple’s consistent attention to accessibility,
and how other tech companies with commitments to accessibility, like
Microsoft and Google, compare to Apple in their accessibility efforts.
It also shows where these companies can improve their consistency, and
that no company is perfect at being an Assistive Technology provider
yet.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple has shown a commitment to
<a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/">accessibility</a> since the early
days of the iPhone, and since mac OSX Tiger. Its VoiceOver screen reader
was the first built-in screen reader of any usability on a personal
computer and smart phone. Now, VoiceOver is on every Apple product, even
the HomePod. It is so prevalent that people I know have begun calling
any screen reader “VoiceOver.” This level of consistency should be
congratulated in a company of Apple’s size and wealth. But is this a
continual trend, and what does this mean for competitors?</p>
<p>This will be an opinion piece. I will not stick only to the facts as we
have them, and won’t give sources for everything which I show as fact.
This article is a testament to how accessibility can be made a
fundamental part of a brand’s experience for effected people, so
feelings and opinions will be involved.</p>
<h2>The trend of accessibility</h2>
<p>The following sections of the article will explore companies trends of
accessibility so far. The focus is on Apple, but I’ll also show some of
what its competitors have done over the years as well. As Apple has a
greater following of blind people, and Applevis has documented so much
of Apple’s progress, I can show more of it than I can its competitors,
whose information written by their followers are scattered, thus harder
to search for.</p>
<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>Apple has a history of accessibility, shown by <a href="http://maccessibility.net/2011/02/10/blind-faith-a-decade-of-apple-accessibility">this
article</a>.
Written just under a decade ago, it goes over the previous decade’s
advancements. As that article has done, I will focus on little of a
company’s talk of accessibility, but more so its software releases and
services.</p>
<p>Apple is, by numbers and satisfaction, the leader in accessibility for
users of its mobile operating systems, but not in general purpose
computer operating systems. Microsoft’s Windows is used far more than
Apple’s MacOS. Besides that, and services, Apple has made its VoiceOver
screen reader on iOS much more powerful, and even flexible, than its
competitor, Google’s TalkBack.</p>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<p>As iPhones were released each year, so were newer versions of iOS. In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-accessibility-ios-6">iOS 6</a>,
accessibility settings began working together, VoiceOver’s Rotor gained
a few new abilities, new braille displays worked with VoiceOver, and
bugs were fixed. In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-and-changed-blind-and-low-vision-users-ios-71">iOS 7</a>,
we gained the ability to have more than one high quality voice, more
Rotor options, and the ability to write text using handwriting.</p>
<p>Next,
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-ios-8-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 8</a>
was pretty special to me, personally, as it introduced the method of
writing text that I almost always use now, Braille Screen Input. This
lets me type on the screen of my phone in braille, making my typing
exponentially faster. Along with typing, I can delete text, a word or
character, and now, send messages from within the input mode. I can also
change braille contraction levels, and lock orientation into one of two
typing modes. Along with this, Apple added the Alex voice, its most
natural yet, which was only before available on a Mac. For those who do
not know braille or handwriting, a new “direct touch typing” method
allows a user to type as quickly as a sighted person, if they can
memorize exactly where the keys are, or have spell check and
autocorrection enabled.</p>
<p>In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-and-changed-ios-9-accessibility-blind-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 9</a>,
VoiceOver users are able to choose Siri voices to speak using VoiceOver,
as an extension of the list of Vocalizer voices, and Apple’s Alex voice.
One can now control speech rate more easily, and the speed of speech can
be greater than previously possible. One can control the time a double
tap should take, a better method of selecting text, braille screen input
improvements, and braille display fixes and new commands.</p>
<p>Then,
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-ios-10-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 10</a>
arrived, with a new way to organize apps, a pronunciation dictionary,
even more voices, reorganized settings, new sounds for actions, a way to
navigate threaded email, and some braille improvements. One great thing
about the pronunciation editor is that it does not only apply to the
screen reader, as in many Windows screen readers, but to the entire
system speech. So, if you use VoiceOver, but also Speak Screen, both
will speak as you have set them to. This is a testament to Apple’s
attention to detail, and control of the entire system.</p>
<p>With the release of
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-ios-11-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users">iOS 11</a>,
we gained the ability to type to Siri, new Siri voices, verbosity
settings, the ability to have subtitles read or brailled, and the
ability to change the speaking pitch of the voice used by VoiceOver.
VoiceOver can now describe some images, which will be greatly expanded
later. We can now find misspelled words, which will also be expanded
later. One can now add and change commands used by braille displays,
which, yes, will be expanded upon later. A few things which haven’t been
expanded upon yet are the ability to read formatting, however imprecise,
with braille “status cells,” and the “reading” of Emoji. Word wrap and a
few other braille features were also added.</p>
<p>Last year, in
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/apple-releases-ios-12-bringing-new-and-enhanced-features-and-performance-improvements">iOS 12</a>,
Apple added commands to jump to formatted text for braille display
users, new Siri voices, verbosity options, confirmation of rotor actions
and sent messages, expansion of the “misspelled” rotor option for
correcting the misspelled word, and the ability to send VoiceOver to an
HDMI output.</p>
<p>Finally, In
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-ios-13-accessibility-individuals-who-are-blind-or-deaf-blind">iOS 13</a>,
Apple moved accessibility to the main settings list, out of the General
section, provided even more natural Siri voices, haptics for VoiceOver,
to aid alongside, or replace, the sounds already present, and the
ability to modify or turn them off. A “vertical scroll bar” has also
been added, as another method of scrolling content. VoiceOver can now
give even greater suggestions for taking pictures, aligning the camera,
and with the iPhone 11, what will be in the picture. One can also
customize commands for the touch screen, braille display, and keyboard,
expanding the ability braille users already had. One can even assign
Siri shortcuts to a VoiceOver command, as Mac users have been able to do
with Apple Script. One can now have VoiceOver interpret charts and
graphs, either via explanations of data, or by an audible representation
of them. This may prove extremely useful in education, and for
visualizing data of any type. Speaking detected text has improved over
the versions to include the detecting of text in unlabeled controls, and
now can attempt to describe images as well. Braille users now have
access to many new braille tables, like Esperanto and several other
languages, although braille no longer switches languages along with
speech.</p>
<h3>MacOS</h3>
<p>MacOS has not seen so much improvement in accessibility over the years.
VoiceOver isn’t a bad screen reader, though. It can be controlled using
a trackpad, which no other desktop screen reader can boast. It can be
used to navigate and activate items with only the four arrow keys. It
uses the considerable amount of voices available on the Mac and for
download. It simply isn’t updated nearly as often as VoiceOver for iOS.</p>
<p>OSX 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9 have seen a few new features, like more
VoiceOver voices, braille improvement, and other things. I couldn’t find
much before Sierra, so we’ll start there.</p>
<p>In Sierra, Apple added VoiceOver commands for controlling volume, to
offset the absence of the physical function keys in new MacBook models.
VoiceOver can also now play a sound for row changes in apps like Mail,
instead of interrupting itself to announce “one row added,” because
Apple’s speech synthesis server on the Mac doesn’t innately support a
speech queue. This means that neither does VoiceOver, so interruptions
must be worked around. Some announcements were changed, HTML content
became web areas, and interaction became “in” and “out of” items. There
were also bug fixes in this release.</p>
<p>In High Sierra, one can now type to Siri, VoiceOver can now switch
languages when reading multilingual text, as VoiceOver on the iPhone has
been able to do since iOS 5 at least, improved braille editing and PDF
reading support, image descriptions, and improved HTML 5 support.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/new-features-changes-and-accessibility-bugs-macos-mojave-blind-and-low-vision-users">MacOS
Mojave</a>,
Apple added the beginning of new iPad apps on Mac. These apps work
poorly with VoiceOver, even still in Catalina. There were no new
reported VoiceOver features in this release.</p>
<p>This year, In <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/new-features-changes-improvements-and-bugs-macos-catalina-blind-and-low-vision-users">MacOS
Catalina</a>,
Apple added more control of punctuation, and XCode 11’s text editor is
now a little more accessible, even though the Playgrounds function
isn’t, and the Books app can now, after years of being on the Mac, be
used for basic reading of books. Braille tables from iOS 13 are also
available in MacOS.</p>
<h3>The future of Apple accessibility</h3>
<p>All of these changes, however, were discovered by users. Apple doesn’t
really talk about all of its accessibility improvements, just some of
the highlights. While I see great potential in accessible diagrams and
graphs, Apple didn’t mention this, and users had to find this.
Subsequently, there may be fixes and features that we still haven’t
found, three versions of iOS 13 later. Feedback between Apple and its
customers has never been great, and this is only to Apple’s detriment.
Since Apple rarely responds to little feedback, users feel that their
feedback doesn’t mean anything, so they stop sending it. Also of note is
that on VoiceOver’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/">Mac accessibility
page</a>, the “Improved
PDF, web, and messages navigation” section is from macOS 10.13, two
versions behind what is currently new in VoiceOver.</p>
<p>Another point is that services haven’t been the most accessible. Chief
among them is Apple Arcade, which <a href="https://applevis.com/forum/apple-arcade-anyone">has no accessible
games</a>, so far. Apple
research, I’ve found, has some questions which have answers that are
simply unlabeled buttons. While Apple TV Plus has audio description for
all of their shows, this is a minor glimmer of light, shrouded by the
inaccessibility of Apple Arcade, which features, now, over one hundred
games, none of which I can play with any success. In all fairness, a
blind person who is patient may be able to play a game like Dear Reader,
which has some accessible items, but the main goal of that game is to
find a word in a different color and correct it, which is completely at
odds with complete blindness, but could be handled using speech
parameter changes, audio cues, or other signals of font, color, or style
changes.</p>
<p>Time will tell if this new direction, no responsibility for not only
other developers’ work, but also the Mac and work done by other
developers and flaunted by Apple, will become the norm. After all, Apple
Arcade is an entire Tab of the App Store; inaccessibility is in plain
view. As a counterpoint, the first iPhone software, and even the second
version, was inaccessible to blind people, but now the iPhone is the
most popular smart phone, in developed nations, for blind people.</p>
<p>Perhaps next year, Apple Arcade will have an accessible game or two. I
can only hope that this outcome comes true, and not the steady stepping
back of Apple from one of their founding blocks: accessibility. We
cannot know, as no one at Apple tells us their plans. We aren’t the only
ones, though, as mainstream technology media shows. We must grow
accustom to waiting on Apple to show new things, and reacting
accordingly, but also providing feedback, and pushing back against
encroaching inaccessibility and decay of macOS.</p>
<h2>Apple’s competitors</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I compare operating systems. To me, an operating
system is the root of all software, and thus, the root of all digital
accessibility. With this in mind, the reader may see why it is
imperative that the operating system be as accessible, easy and
delightful to use, and promote productivity as much as possible.
Microsoft and Google are the largest competitors of Apple in the closed
source operating system space, so they are what I will compare Apple to
in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p>Google is the main contributor to the Android and Chromium projects.
While both are open source, both are simply a base to be worked from,
not the end result. Not even Google’s phones run “pure” Android, but
have Google services and probably other things on the phone as well.
Both, though, have varying accessibility as well. While Apple pays great
attention to its mobile operating system’s accessibility, Google does
not seem to put many resources towards that. However, its Chrome OS,
which is used much in education, is much more easily accessible, and
even somewhat of an enjoyable experience for a lite operating system.</p>
<h4>Android</h4>
<p>Android was released one year after iOS. TalkBack was released as part
of Android 1.6. Back then, it only supported navigation via a keyboard,
trackpad, or scroll ball. It wasn’t until version 4 when touch screen
access was implemented into TalkBack for phones, and up to this day,
only supports commands done with one finger, two finger gestures being
passed through to Android as one finger commands. TalkBack has worked
around this issue by recently, in Android version 8, gaining the ability
to use the finger print sensor, if available, as a gesture pad for
setting options, and the ability the switch spoken language, if using
Google TTS, when reading text in more than one language. TalkBack uses
graphical menus for setting options otherwise, or performing actions,
like deleting email. It can be used with a Bluetooth keyboard. By
default, it uses Google TTS, a lower quality, offline version of speech
used for things like Google Translate, Google Maps, and the Google Home.
TalkBack cannot use the higher quality Google TTS voices. Instead,
voices from other vendors are downloaded for more natural sound.</p>
<p>BrailleBack, discussed <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/3535226">on its Google Support
page</a>,
is an accessibility service which, when used with TalkBack running,
provides rudamentary braille support to Android. Commands are rugged,
meaningless, and unfamiliar to users of other screen readers, and
TalkBack’s speech cannot be turned off while using Brailleback, meaning
that, as one person helpfully provided, that one must plug in a pair of
headphones and not wear them, or turn down the phone’s volume, to gain
silent usage of one’s phone using braille. Silent reading is one of
braille’s main selling points, but accessibility, if not given the
resources necessary, can become a host of workarounds. Furthermore,
brailleback must be installed onto the phone, providing another barrier
to entry for many deaf-blind users, so some simply buy iPods for braille
if they wish to use an Android phone for customization or contrarian
reasons, or simply stick with the iPhone as most blind people do.</p>
<p>Now, though, many have moved to a new screen reader created by a Chinese
developer, called Commentary. This screen reader does, however, have the
ability to <a href="https://www.inclusiveandroid.com/content/commentary-screen-reader-decrypts-your-phone-if-you-have-full-encryption-turned">decrypt your
phone</a>
if you have encryption enabled. For braille users,
<a href="https://brltty.app">BRLTTY</a> is used for braille usage. This level of
customization, offset by the level of access which apps have to do
anything they wish to your phone, is an edge that some enjoy living on,
and it does allow things like third-party, and perhaps better screen
readers, text to speech engines, apps for blind people like <a href="https://www.seeingwithsound.com">The
vOICe</a>, which gives blind people
artificial vision, and other gray area apps like emulators, which iOS
will not accept on the App Store. Users who are technically inclined do
tend to thrive on Android, finding workarounds a joy to find and use,
whereas people who are not, or are but do not want to fiddle with apps
to replace first-party apps which do not meet the needs of the user, and
unoptimized settings, find themselves doing more configuring of the
phone than using it.</p>
<p>Third party offerings, like launchers, mail apps, web browsers, file
managers, all have variable accessibility, which can change from version
to version. Therefore, one must navigate the shifting landscape of first
party tools which may sort of be good enough, third party tools which
are accessible enough but may not do everything you need, and tools
which users have found workarounds for using them. Third party speech
synthesizers are also hit or miss, with some not working at all, others,
like Eloquence, being now unsupported, and more, like ESpeak, sounding
unnatural. The only good braille keyboard which is free hasn’t been
updated in years, and Google has not made one of their own.</p>
<p>Because of all this, it is safe to say that Android can be a powerful
tool, but has not attained the focus needed to become a great
accessibility tool as well. Google has begun locking down its operating
system, taking away some things that apps could do before. This may come
to inhibit third party tools which blind people now use to give Android
better accessibility. I feel that it is better to have been on iOS,
where things are locked down much, but you have, at least somewhat, a
clear expectation of fairness on Apple’s part. Android is not a big
income source for Google, so Google does not have to answer to app
developers.</p>
<h4>Chrome OS</h4>
<p>Chrome OS is Google’s desktop operating system, running Chrome as the
browser, with support for running Android apps. Its accessibility has
improved plenty over the years, with ChromeVox gaining many features
which make it a good screen reader. You can <a href="http://www.chromevox.com">read more about
chromeVox</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main successes to ChromeVox is its braille support. It is
normal for most first-party screen readers to support braille nowadays.
When one plugs in a braille display to a Chromebook with ChromeVox
enabled, ChromeVox begins using that display automatically, if it is
supported. The surprise here is that if one plugs it in when ChromeVox
is off, ChromeVox will automatically turn on, and begin using the
display. This is beyond what other screen readers can do. ChromeVox, and
indeed TalkBack, do not yet support scripting, editing punctuation and
pronounciation speech, and do not have “activities” as VoiceOver for iOS
and Mac have, but ChromeVox feels much more polished and ready for use
than TalkBack.</p>
<h3>The future of Google accessibility</h3>
<p>Judging by the past, Google may add a few more features to TalkBack, but
less than Apple adds to iOS. They have much to catch up on, however, as
they have only two years ago added the ability for TalkBack to detect
and switch languages, and use the finger print sensor like VoiceOver’s
rotor. I have not seem much change over the two years since, except
making a mode for tracking focus from a toggle to a mandatory feature. I
suspect that, in time, they will remove the option to disable explore by
touch, if they’ve not already.</p>
<p>With Chrome OS, and Google Chrome in general, I hope that the future
brings better things, now that Microsoft is involved in Chromium
development. It could become even more tied to web standards. Perhaps
ChromeVox will gain better sounding offline voices than Android’s lower
quality Google TTS ones, or gain sounds performed using spacial audio
for deeper immersion.</p>
<h3>Microsoft</h3>
<p>Microsoft makes only one overarching operating system, with changes for
XBox, HoloLens, personal computers, and other types of hardware. Windows
has always been the dominant operating system for general purpose
computing for blind people. It hasn’t always been accessible, and it is
only in recent years that Microsoft have actively turned their attention
to accessibility on Windows and XBox.</p>
<p>Now, Windows’ accessibility increases with each update, and Narrator
becomes a more useful screen reader. I feel that, in a year or so, blind
people may be trained to use Narrator instead of other screen readers on
Windows.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>In the early days of Windows, there were many different screen readers
competing for dominance.
<a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">JAWS</a>, Job
Access with Speech, was the most dominant, with
<a href="https://www.gwmicro.com/Window-Eyes/">Window-Eyes</a>, now abandoned, as
second. They gathered information from the graphics card to describe
what was on the screen. There were no accessibility interfaces back
then.</p>
<p>Years later, when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Active_Accessibility">MSAA</a>,
Microsoft Active Accessibility, was created, Window-Eyes decided to lean
on that, while JAWS continued to use video intercept technology to
gather information. In Windows 2000, Microsoft shipped a basic screen
reader, Narrator. It wasn’t meant to be a full, useful screen reader,
but one made so that a user could set up a more powerful one.</p>
<p>Now, we have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32">UI
Automation</a>,
which is still not a very mature product, as screen readers are still
not using it for everything, like Microsoft Office. GW Micro, makers of
Window-eyes, bonded with AI Squared, producers of the ZoomText
magnifier, which was bought by Freedom Scientific, whom promptly
abandoned Window-eyes. These days, JAWS is being taken on by
<a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a>, Nonvisual Desktop Access, a free and
<em>open source</em> screen reader, and Microsoft’s own Narrator screen reader.</p>
<p>In Windows 8, Microsoft began adding features to Narrator. Now, in
Windows 10, four years later, Narrator has proven itself useful, and in
some situations, helpful in ways that all other screen readers have not
been. For example, one can install, setup, and begin using Windows 10
using Narrator. Narrator is the only self-described screen reader which
can, with little configuration, show formatting not by describing it,
but by changing its speech parameters to “show” formatting by sound. The
only other access technology which does this automatically is
<a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak">Emacspeak</a>, the “complete audio
desktop.” Its braille support must be downloaded and installed, for now,
but is still better than Android’s support. Narrator cannot, however,
use a laptop’s trackpad for navigation. Instead, Microsoft decided to
add such spacial navigation to touchscreens, meaning that a user must
reach up and feel around a large screen, instead of using the level
trackpad as a smaller, more manageable area.</p>
<p>Speaking of support, Microsoft’s support system is better in a few ways.
First, unlike Apple, their feedback system allows more communication
between the community and Microsoft developers. Users can comment on
issues, and developers can ask questions, a bit like on Github. Windows
Insider builds come with announcements by Microsoft with what is new,
changed, fixed, and broken. If anything changes regarding accessibility,
it is in the release notes. Microsoft is vocal about what is new in
accessibility of Windows, in an era when many other companies seem
almost ashamed to mention it in release notes. This is much better than
Apple’s silence on many builds of their beta software, and no notice of
accessibility improvements and features at all. Microsoft’s transparency
is a breath of fresh air to me, as I am much more confident in their
commitment to accessibility for it.</p>
<p>Their commitment, however, doesn’t seem to pervade the whole company.
The Microsoft Rewards program is hard to use for me, and contains
quizzes where answers must be dragged and dropped. This may be fun for
sighted users, but I cannot do them with any level of success, so they
aren’t fun for me at all. Another problem is the quality of speech.
While Apple has superb speech options like Macintalk Alex, Vocalizer, or
the Siri voices, Microsoft’s offline voices sound bored, pause for too
long, and have a robotic buzzing sound as they speak. I think that a
company of Microsoft’s size could invest in better speech technology, or
make their online voices available for download for offline use.
Feedback has been given about this issue, so perhaps the next version of
Windows will have more pleasant speech.</p>
<p>Windows has a few downsides, though. It doesn’t support sound through
its Linux subsystem, meaning I cannot use Emacs, with Emacspeak.
Narrator does not yet report when a program opens, or when a new window
appears, and other visual system events. Many newer Universal Windows
apps can be tricky to navigate, and the Mail app still automatically
expands threads as I arrow to them, which I do not want to happen,
making the mail app annoying to use.</p>
<h3>The future of Microsoft accessibility</h3>
<p>I think that the future of Microsoft, regarding accessibility, is very
bright. They seem dedicated to the cause, seeking feedback much more
aggressively than Apple or Google, and many in the blind community love
giving it to them. Windows will improve further, possibly with Narrator
gaining the ability to play interface sounds in immersive audio using
Windows Sonic for Headphones, braille becoming a deeper, and built in
part of Narrator, and higher quality speech made available for download.
Since Microsoft is also a gaming company, it could work on creating
sound scapes for different activities: browsing the web, writing text,
coding, reading, to aid in focus or creativity. Speech synthesis could
be given even more parameters for speaking even more types of formatting
or interface item types. really, with Microsoft’s attention to feedback,
I feel that their potential is considerable for accessibility. Then
again, it is equally possible that Apple will implement these features,
but they aren’t as inviting as Microsoft when it comes to sharing what
I’d <em>love</em> in an operating system as Microsoft has been, so I now just
report bugs, not giving Apple new ideas.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It may be interesting to note the symmetry of accessibility: Apple’s
phone is the dominant phone, but Microsoft’s Windows platform is the
dominant laptop and desktop system among blind people. Apple’s iPhone is
more accessible than Google’s Android, but Google’s Chrome OS is more
polished and updated accessibility-wise than Apple’s MacOS. Personally,
I use a Mac because of its integration with iOS Notes, Messages, Mail,
and other services, the Mail app is a joy to breeze through email with,
and open source tools like Emacs with Emacspeak do not work as well on
Windows. Also, speech matters to me, and I’d probably fall asleep much
more often hearing Microsoft’s buzzing voices than the somewhat
energetic sound of Alex on the Mac, who speaks professionally, calmly,
and never gets bored. I do, however, use Windows for heavy usage of the
web, especially Google web apps and services, and gaming.</p>
<p>Time will tell if companies continue in their paths, Apple forging
ahead, Microsoft burning bright, and Google… being Google. I hope,
nevertheless, that this article has been useful for the reader, and that
my opinions have been as fair as possible towards the companies. It
should be noted that the accessibility teams for each company are
individuals, have their own ideas of what accessibility is, means, and
should be, and should be treated with care. After all, this past decade
has been a long journey of, probably, most effort spent convincing
managers that the features we now have are worth spending time on, and
answering user complaints of “my phone is talking to me and i want it
turned off right now!”.</p>
<p>This does not excuse them for the decay of Android and Mac
accessibility, and the lack of great speech options on Windows. It does
not excuse them for Apple Arcade’s lack of accessible games, or
Microsoft Rewards’ inaccessible quizzes. We must give honest, complete,
and critical feedback to these people. After all, they do not know what
we need, what will be useful, or, if we dare tell, what will be
delightful for us to use, unless we give them this feedback. This
applies to all software, whether it be Apple’s silent gathering of
feedback, Microsoft’s open arms and inviting offers, or open source
software’s issue trackers, Discord servers, mailing lists, and Github
repositories. If we want improvement, we must ask for it. If we want a
better future, we must make ourselves heard in the present. Let us all
remember the past, so that we can influence the future.</p>
<p>Now, what do you think of all this? Do you believe Apple will continue
to march ahead regarding accessibility, or do you think that Microsoft,
or even Google, has something bigger planned? Do you think that Apple is
justified in their silence, or do you hope that they begin speaking more
openly about their progress, at least in release notes? Do you like how
open Microsoft is about accessibility, or do they even talk about
accessibility for blind users enough to you? I’d love to know your
comments, corrections, and constructive criticism, either in the
comments, on Twitter, or anywhere else you can find me. Thanks so much
for reading!</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll detail my experiences of advocating for
accessibility in open source software, why it is important, and how
others can help. I’ve not been doing it for long, but at least now,
I’ve done a bit. I’ll also touch upon why I think open source
software, on all operating systems, is important, and what closed
source and closed feedback systems cannot offer, which open source
grants. On the other hand, there are things which closed source
somewhat grants, but which has faltered slightly in recent days. I
will attempt to denote what is fact and what is opinion, this goes for
any post of a commentary of informative nature.</p>
<h3>The Appeal of Open Source</h3>
<p>Open source, or free software, basically means that a person can view
and change the source code of software that they download or own.
While this doesn’t mean much to users, it does mean that many
different people can work on a project to make it better. This has no
value on its own, see the "heartbleed" <a href="http://heartbleed.com">SSL
bug</a> and its
<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/evolution-openssl-security-after-heartbleed">Aftermath</a>,
but as with SSL, things can obviously improve when given an incentive.</p>
<p>For now, open source technology is used in many closed source
operating systems. For example, the
<a href="https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis">Liblouis</a> braille tables are
used in
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-ios-13-accessibility-individuals-who-are-blind-or-deaf-blind">iOS</a>,
<a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/new-features-changes-improvements-and-bugs-macos-catalina-blind-and-low-vision-users">macOS</a>,
and most Linux distributions through <a href="https://brltty.app">BRLTTY</a>.
While the software is not perfect, it is often made for more than one
operating system, has a helpful community of users, and, greatest for
accessibility, developers who are more likely to consider
accessibility. This is greatly improved with platforms for open source
development, like Github and Gitlab, which allow users to post
"issues" on projects, including accessibility ones.</p>
<h3>The Appeal of Closed Source</h3>
<p>People like getting paid. I should know, as a working blind person who
does love getting paid for time and effort well spent. People love
keeping things hidden while being worked on. I wouldn’t want a reader
reading an incomplete blog post, after all, and spreading the word
that "Devin just kind of wrote a few words and that’s all I got. from
the blog." People love being able to claim their work as theirs,
instead of having to share the credits with other people or companies.
I don’t have direct experience with this, because I need all the help
I can get, but in my opinion, it is a factor in choosing to create on
your own, as a user or a company. Another great thing about closed
source is that your competitors can’t copy what you’re doing, as you
do it, and when you’re an important company, with allegiance to your
shareholders, you must do anything to keep making money. But, what
about accessibility?</p>
<h3>Open Source Accessibility</h3>
<p>Accessibility of open source projects vary a lot. For example, before
Retroarch was <a href="https://www.libretro.com/index.php/retroarch-1-8-2-coming-soon-accessibility-features-for-blind-people/">made
accessible</a>,
its interface was not usable by blind people. Now, though, I can use
it easily. However, current versions of the <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop">KDE Plasma
desktop</a> do not work well with <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/">the
Orca screen reader</a>. The
following quote is from the release notes for KDE’s latest desktop
version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KDE is an international technology team that creates free and open
source software for desktop and portable computing. Among KDE's
products are a modern desktop system for Linux and UNIX platforms,
comprehensive office productivity and groupware suites and hundreds
of software titles in many categories including Internet and web
applications, multimedia, entertainment, educational, graphics and
software development. KDE software is translated into more than 60
languages and is built with ease of use and modern accessibility
principles in mind. KDE's full-featured applications run natively on
Linux, BSD, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.17.0.php">Source</a></p>
<p>"Modern accessibility principals," you say? In my opinion, we seem to
be talking about different definitions of "accessibility." Yes, there
are multiple definitions. One is accessibility in the sense of being
able to be accessed, another is the ability to be found, and the
ability of being easy to deal with. As stated in the About section of
the site, I use accessibility to mean being able to be used
<em>completely</em> by blind people. This carries with it the implication
that every single function, and all needed visual information, can be
conveyed to a blind person in order for it to be accessible. This
rules out the "good enough" approach that so many blind people accept
as the status quo. Luckily for blind people who would love to use KDE,
there is <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gladhorn/2018/10/14/screen-reader-accessibility-for-the-plasma-desktop/">work being
done</a>
on this issue. Gnu, the project behind much of Linux, also has an
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/accessibility/">accessibility statement</a>, which
does seem to be very out of date, as it references flash player and
Silverlight, which are no longer in common use, and does not reference
Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android, and other modern technologies which are
not open source, but which include assistive technologies. I encourage every adventurous blind person to make
themselves available for testing open source software and operating
systems; user testing was mentioned by the KDE team as something blind
people could do to help.
Believe me, having an operating system which is a "joy to use" is a
<em>dream</em> of mine.</p>
<p>Gnome, and Mate, accessibility are okay, but they do not come close to
the accessibility of Windows and Mac systems. For a good example, if
you press Alt + F1 in Gnome, and probably Mate too, you may only hear
"window." Advanced users will know to type something in Gnome, or use
the Arrow Keys in Mate, but regular users should not have to learn to
hunt around due to bad accessibility, and the fact that less
technically inclined users use Linux is a testament to blind people’s
ingenuity and ability to adapt, rather than the accessibility of the
platform.</p>
<p>Open source accessibility is so hit and miss because there are so many
standards. There is the GTK framework for building graphical apps,
which does have some accessibility support, but developers must label
the items in their programs with text. There is the QT framework,
which seems to have more poor accessibility support. Basically,
developers can do anything they want, which is good for freedom, but
often is not great for accessibility. Also, much of the community has
not heard of accessibility practices, do not know that blind people
use computers, or think that we must use braille interfaces to
interact with computers and digital devices. This is a failure on our
part, as we do not "get out there" on the Internet enough. With the
advent of an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/">accessible Reddit
client</a>, this may begin
to change. Further work must be done to give blind users an accessible
Reddit interface on the web for users to use on computers, not
iPhones. However, Github is very accessible, and there is nothing
stopping one from submitting issues.</p>
<h3>Closed Source Accessibility</h3>
<p>"Okay but what about Windows? And Apple? You like Apple, right?"
Basically, it’s hard to tell. Software doesn’t write itself, it is
written, for now, by people. People can make mistakes, ignore
guidelines, or simply not care about accessibility. However, those
guidelines do exist, and are usually one standard, like the iOS
accessibility standard. This means that companies can develop
accessible software easily, and are held accountable by managers to
uphold accessibility. But, even the best of accessible companies do
not always do the right thing. Apple, for example, has created two
services, Apple Arcade and Apple Research. Apple Arcade contains <em>no</em>
games which a blind gamer can play without expending much more effort
than a sighted gamer. Apple Research contains some questions with
answer buttons which are not labeled, or cannot be activated. Does
Apple think that blind people do not want to game, or that we don’t
care about our hearing, heart, or for women, their reproductive
health? Apple has also created Swift Playgrounds, an app for children
to learn to code. This is accessible. But what about adults? Shouldn’t
blind adults, who are usually technically inclined enough, be given a
chance to learn to code? I’ll probably rant about this in a future
article.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been on an accessibility journey for a few years now,
but even they have a few problems. First, the voices in Windows 10 are
poor for screen reading tasks. They pause way too long at the end of
clauses and sentences, leading me, at least, to press Down Arrow to
move to the next line before the last line was actually done being
spoken, all because it paused just long enough to make me think that
there was no more text to speak. Microsoft’s XBox Game Pass is great,
but I could not find any accessible games in the free rotations. Sure,
there’s Killer Instinct that many blind people can enjoy playing, but
I found it not only inaccessible, as the menus do not speak, but
boring, as the characters all seemed to simply do the same thing. I
know that games do not have to be accessible to be fun, but I expect
companies who showcase games, like Apple with Arcade, to have at least
one accessible game for blind people to enjoy. And I also know that
neither Apple nor Microsoft makes these games, but they do choose to
advertise them, endorse them even, and it shows that, for Apple Arcade
at least, video games are not something which they expect blind people
to play. Microsoft is proving them wrong, with the
release of Halo with screen reader usability in menus, and the
possibility that the new Halo game will be accessible.</p>
<p>Another problem with Microsoft is that not all of their teams are
onboard. Like Apple with Arcade and Research, Microsoft has the
Rewards team. Their quizzes require one to move items around to
reorder answers to get the quiz correct. This may be easy, and perhaps
fun, for sighted people, but are simply frustrating for blind people.
Other problems include the release of the new Microsoft Edge, which,
for most users of screen readers, require that the user turn off UI
Automation in order to read some items on the web. Otherwise, if
Microsoft’s upcoming foldable phone comes with greatly enhanced
accessibility relative to pure Android, and the Narrator screen
reader, optimized and made great and enjoyable for a mobile
experience, I think that Microsoft could take plenty of market share back
from Apple of mobile phone users. They already have most general
purpose computer users who are blind, so taking from Apple would be a
huge win for them regarding accessibility. But, on that, we’ll have to
wait and see how far Microsoft takes their commitment to
accessibility. The more cynical side of me says that Microsoft will
simply slap Android on a folding phone and release it, because why
fight Apple.</p>
<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
<p>So, what can we do to make accessibility better? Just about all open
source software, including the stuff making up this blog, is hosted on
Github. Just about all companies, of closed source software, claim to
want your feedback. So, I recommend giving them any feedback you have.
I know that giving feedback to Apple is like throwing $100 bills into
the ocean, giving your valuable time to something which may offer no
results, and just gives you the robotic "thanks" message. I know that
sometimes talking to Microsoft’s accessibility team may seem
unproductive, because they lead you from Twitter to one of a number of
feedback locations. I know that feedback to open source software
projects may take a lot of time and explaining and promoting
accessibility to a community which has never considered it before, but
it all may help.</p>
<p>For a great, and successful, Github issue regarding accessibility, see
<a href="https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/9661">this issue on accessibility of
Retroarch</a>. You can
see that I approached the Retroarch team respectfully, with knowledge
of basic accessibility and computer terminology. Note that I gave what
should happen, what is happening, and what can be done to fix the
problem. As the saying goes, if you do not contribute to a solution to
a problem, you are a part of the problem. Blind people will need to
remember to give solutions, not just whine about something not working
and can’t play Poke A Man like everyone else.</p>
<p>Also, share links to your feedback with other blind people who can
vote, thumb up, or comment on it. Remember, if you do comment, please
remember that feedback does not net instant results. I’m still waiting
on <a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/211">Webcamoid to have an accessible
interface</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/9920">Adding Active Accessibility into Games for
Retroarch</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/rileytestut/DeltaCore/issues/13">This Delta
issue</a>. But, at
least I’ll know when something changes, and I could even <a href="https://www.bountysource.com">Pay for
features to be implemented</a>.</p>
<p>This is opposed to the closed source model, where feedback is "passed
on to the team," or you are thanked, by your iPhone, for your
feedback, but do not hear anything back from developers, and you most
definitely can not pay for specific features to be worked on, or
donate to projects that you feel deserve it. You must hope and have
faith that large companies with more than one billion users cares
enough to hear you. For perspective, if every blind person stopped
using an iPhone, Apple would not miss many lost sales, compared to the
billions of sighted users. However, the engineers who work on iOS
accessibility are people too, with deadlines, lives, and feelings, and
we should also respect that they are probably tightly restricted in
answering feedback, fixing bugs, and creating new, exciting features.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for me, I will continue to support open source software. I’ll keep
using this mac and iPhone because they work the best for me and what I
do for work and writing. But, believe me, when something better comes
along, I’ll jump ship quickly. As blind people, I feel, we cannot
afford to develop brand loyalty. Apple, Microsoft, or Google, I think,
could
drop accessibility tomorrow, and there we’d be, left in the cold. I
highly doubt they will. They may let it lie stagnant, but they
probably won’t remove it. I do not write this to scare you in the
least, but to make you think about how much control you actually have
over what you use, how companies and developers view us, and how we
can improve the situation for ourselves. if sighted people notice a
bug or want a feature in iOS or Windows, they can gather their tech
press and pressure Apple or Microsoft. If we find an accessibility
bug, do we have enough clout, or unity, to pressure these companies?
Writing feedback, testing software, trying new things, writing guides
and fixing documentation, or, if able, translating software into other
languages are all things that <em>any</em> blind person can do. I’m not
saying that I’m perfect at any of this. I just think that we as a
community can grow tremendously if we strike out from our comfortable
Windows PC’s, Microsoft Word, audio games, TeamTalk, and old speech
synthesizers.</p>
<p>I’ll give some projects you could try out and give feedback on:</p>
