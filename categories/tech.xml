I've never been able to get my mind
around loops, if and else, for and while, and break almost breaks me
instead of the code. However, many people make it look easy, and for
them, it probably is. In iOS 14, Apple may loosen their chains upon
their technology enough for developers to explore the boundaries of what
a pocket computer can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is very controlling. All of its operating systems can only run
on its own hardware. Its hardware can only be used to practically run
officially sanctioned operating systems, unless a Linux user can get
passed the security on the Mac. And, for a long time, notwithstanding
workarounds that have never been so easy, apps on iOS have only been
usable if they were downloaded through Apple's own App Store. In iOS
14, however, things may change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Applevis released a blog post about iOS 14 possibly
gaining &lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/apple-reported-be-exploring-ways-let-developers-provide-custom-text-speech-synthesizers-ios"&gt;Custom Text to Speech engine
support&lt;/a&gt;.
While I won't write about it here, as it seems a minor topic to me, I
will say that this is something that the community of blind people
have been asking for since VoiceOver revolutionized our lives.
Furthermore, though, it is greater evidence that Apple is beginning to
open up, just a tad. it isn't, however, the first time we've seen
Apple open up, a bit, for accessibility reasons. Apple allows us, in
iOS 13, to change VoiceOver commands, and it uses the &lt;a href="http://liblouis.org"&gt;Liblouis
braille tables&lt;/a&gt; to display languages in Braille
that weren't available before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will discuss and theorize about the availability of
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/21/rumor-mobile-version-of-xcode-for-ipad/"&gt;XCode on
iOS&lt;/a&gt;,
which is supposedly going to be released this year, and how it can help
people learn to code, bring
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading"&gt;sideloading&lt;/a&gt; to many more
people, and how it can bring emulation in full force to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning to code on iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've said before, coding has never been easy for me. My skills are
still very much at the beginner level. I can write "print" statements in
Python, and maybe in Swift, but languages like Quorum, Java, and C++ are
so verbose and require much more forethought than Python. Swift seems a
bit like Python, although just as complex as Java and more verbose
languages when one becomes more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With XCode on the Mac, accessibility isn't great. Editing text is okay,
but even viewing output seems impossible on first look, and I'm still
not sure if it can even be done. This means that the &lt;a href="https://books.apple.com/book/id1118575552"&gt;Intro to App
development with Swift&lt;/a&gt;
Playground materials are inaccessible. This has been verified today with
the XCode 10 version. Sure, we can read the source code, but cannot
directly activate the "next" link to move to the next page. And no,
workarounds are not equal access. Furthermore, neither teachers nor
students should have to look for workarounds to use a course created by
Apple, one of the richest companies in the world, whose accessibility
team is great, for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I expect XCode for iOS will be a new beginning, of
sorts, for all teams who work on it, not just the accessibility team. It
will be a way for new, young developers to come to coding on their
phone, or more probably, their iPad, without the history of workarounds
that many developers on the Mac who are blind know today. It will also
allow blind developers to create powerful, accessible apps. If it is
true that Macs will run Apple's own "A" processor someday, then perhaps
this XCode for iOS will move to the Mac, as Apple TV is attempting to
do. Hopefully, by then, iOS apps on the Mac will actually be usable,
instead of messes, accessibility-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows users also cannot currently officially code for iOS. Most blind
users have a Windows computer and an iPhone. Having XCode on iOS will
allow more blind people, who are good at coding, to try their hand at
developing iOS apps. This could also bring more powerful apps,
as blind Windows users are used to the power of programs like
Foobar2000, NVDA addons, and lots of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of having XCode on iOS is that, because of the number
of users, there will be even more people working on open source
projects, which they could easily download and import into XCode. For
example, perhaps &lt;a href="https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/11696"&gt;PPSSPP User InterFace
accessibility&lt;/a&gt; could
be improved, or the Delta emulator could become &lt;a href="https://github.com/rileytestut/DeltaCore/issues/13"&gt;completely accessible
and
groundbreaking&lt;/a&gt;.
Of course, closed source app development could be aided by this as
well, but it is harder to join, or make, a closed source development
team than it is to contribute to an open source one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sideloading with XCode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sideloading is the process of running apps on iOS which are not accepted
by the iOS App Store. These include video game console emulators,
torrent downloaders, and apps which allow users to watch "free" movies
and TV shows. The last set of apps, I agree, shouldn't be on the app
store, but the first two are not illegal, but simply could facilitate
illegal operations; pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sideloading can be done in many ways. You can load the XCode project
into XCode for Mac, build it, and send it to your own device. This must
be renewed every seven days, but is the most difficult technically to
do. You can sign up for a third-party app store, which allows you to
download apps which are hosted elsewhere and may not be the latest
version, but there is a good chance that the certificate which they use
to sign the app will be revoked by Apple. Finally, there are a few apps
which automate the signing of apps, and pushes the app to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of these methods, however, require a Mac computer. Many people,
especially blind people, only use a Windows computer and an iPhone. This
usually isn't a problem, as most blind people either use their phone for
much of what they do, or use their computer for much of what they do.
However, this means that people who have Windows, but not a Mac, cannot
sideload apps. So, if a blind person creates an extension to alert you
that your screen curtain isn't on, which means that a VoiceOver user
doesn't have a feature enabled so that the screen is blank, that app
cannot be distributed on the App Store, and cannot be sideloaded by
Windows users. And I highly doubt a third-party app store would host
such a niche app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emulating with XCode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emulators were once a legal gray area. They allow gamers to play video
games, from game consoles like the Playstation Portable, on computers,
tablets, or phones. They have become legal, however, due to Sony's
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp."&gt;lawsuits of emulator
developers&lt;/a&gt;.
While emulation is legal, however, downloading games from the Internet,
unless, some say, you own the game, is not. Steve Jobs himself, at the
1999 MacWorld conference, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vN2vxYnAZf0?t=5038"&gt;showed off an
emulator&lt;/a&gt;, one for playing
Playstation games. Now, emulators are not allowed onto the iOS App
Store, unless they have been made by the developers of the games which
are being emulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XCode on iOS would also help in emulator use. The more people use
emulators, the more their use will spread. iPhones are also definitely
powerful enough to run emulators; the newer the iPhone, the faster the
emulation. An iPhone X R, for example, is powerful enough to run a
Playstation Portable game at full speed, even while not being
optimized for the hardware, and being interpreted. It's like running
nearly a PS3 game using Python. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVkYhCmq-dI"&gt;A video I
made&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates this.
The game, Dissidia DuoDecim, isn't as accessible as its predecessor.
However, it runs, as far as I could tell, at full speed. This
spectacularly shows that the computers in our pockets, the ones we use
to drone over Facebook, be riled up by news sites, or play Pokemon Go,
are much more powerful, and are capable of far more than what we use
of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, since blind people will have access to the code ran with XCode,
fixes to sound, the user interface, and even enhancements to both, are
possible. PSP games could be enhanced using Apple's &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/audio/"&gt;3D audio
effects&lt;/a&gt;. Games could be described
using Apple's &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision"&gt;Machine Learning
Vision&lt;/a&gt; technology.
This applies to even more than accessibility, however. Since more users
will be learning to code, or finally have the ability to code for iOS,
bugs in iOS ports of open source software can more quickly be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I have discussed the possibility of XCode for iOS, and
how it could improve learning to code, sideloading apps, and emulation
of video games. I hope that this information has been informative, and
has enlivened the imaginations of my readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what do you all think? Are you a blind person who wants to learn to
code in an accessible environment? Are you a sighted person who wants to
play Final Fantasy VII on your phone? Or are you one who wants to help
fix accessibility issues in apps? Discussion is very welcome, anywhere
this post is shared to. I welcome any feedback, input, or corrections.
And, as always, thank you so much for reading this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>apple</category><category>blindness</category><category>tech</category><guid>https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-04-21-a-brighter-apple/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 12:15:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Appleâs Ecosystem and Accessibility</title><link>https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-03-27-apple-ecosystem/</link><dc:creator>Devin Prater</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, my Airpods Pro began making a clicking sound, when
in Noise Cancellation or transparency mode. I didnât think much of it,
and just used them regularly, until sound began distorting after a
while of listening. Iâve simply stopped using them, as I shudder to
think how much a cab ride to the nearest Apple Store, potentially an
hour away, would cost. This is only one problem with the Apple
ecosystem: being locked into Appleâs wireless headphones, other
Bluetooth headphones, or other workarounds, and Apple Stores being far
away, which is what Iâll be focusing on in this article. I will show,
in the following paragraphs, how Appleâs handling of its ecosystem
effects the hardware and software regarding accessibility matters.
These matters may effect some in the general population, but people
with disabilities are effected much more acutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appleâs hardware has usually been very well built. Reviewers often
talk about nothing else. From the iPhoneâs camera, iPadâs screen,
Macâs CPU and RAM, to the Watchâs health sensors, and the Airpodâs H1
chip, hardware, for Apple, is a big part of their products, and
reviewers focus on that. But how does that help or hinder accessibility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The TouchBar on the Mac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2016, Appleâs &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; gained the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/touch-bar-mchlbfd5b039/mac"&gt;Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;, a touch strip
across the top of the keyboard, replacing the function keys. The
reason was to add variable icons which could visibly change functions
across the operating system. Many people may have liked this change,
as they could use hand-eye coordination to perform functions they
otherwise would have used the trackpad and menus for. These type of
users would not have known about keyboard shortcuts, using the
function keys, and other easy ways of getting the same functions done
without needing yet another touch input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind people, however, are a bit different. We usually know many
keyboard shortcuts, use the function keys without a problem, and do
not always need a touch screen. The Touch Bar can be used, but it is
much slower, as we have no tactile way of finding just one distinct
item on the touch bar, like the play/pause button, or the volume
slider. Once we have found the function we want, we must tap it twice
to activate, like a sighted person must left click twice, once to
focus the item, the next to activate it. In fact, VoiceOver, the
screen reader for the Mac, had to adopt a command to raise or lower
the volume via keyboard, since it is slower to do so on the Touch Bar.
On the other hand, most operating system and application features can
be accessed via keyboard commands, so I only need to use the Touch Bar
for system functions like volume, brightness of the screen, and media
playback when Iâm not in the media player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a blind person wants to use their Mac as a Windows machine also,
through Bootcamp, they must attach an external keyboard, or simply not
use the function keys, as Windows screen readers have no such notion
of a Touch Bar function key row, thus will not read what a user is
selecting, and will also not let a user explore the touch bar to find
a function before activating them, so one touch activates an item,
even if it isnât the one a user wants. See &lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/forum/macbook-pro-touch-bar-windows-10"&gt;this Applevis forum post&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that Apple should have made this change on the MacBook Air, for
regular consumers, and left the Pro machines alone. Yes, they could
have made the power button into the Touch ID button on the pro
machines, and I hope that, just as they revived the scissor-switch
keyboards, they revive the Function keys as well. It would help me
greatly in doing even simple tasks easier, like pausing, skipping, and
rewinding audio, and handling volume and brightness more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still hope, however. This year, Apple released the MacBook
Air refresh with the new keyboard. It has an Escape key, at least.
Now, they just need to add back the other twelve keys on that row, and
things will be back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The headphone jack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016âs iPhone 7 and 7+, Apple removed the headphone jack, replacing
it with their own Airpods, other Bluetooth headphones, and Lightning
audio. They did not add another Lightning port onto the phone so that
one could listen to wired headphones and charge the phone at the same
time, or, as they did with the TouchBar on the MacBook, but left
people to choose between wireless options if one wanted to be able to
listen and charge the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, this isnât an issue. They donât usually need
headphones, only using them when listening to music or movies, or
playing games. Even then, some people just listen on speakers built
into their phone, or use external speakers, like the HomePod. They
also do not have to worry about latency. Music is not effected by it,
and videos are usually delayed, so that the picture synchronizes with
the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For blind people, however, headphones are important. In order to use
an iPhone, most blind people use a screen reader, which speaks
information out loud using a voice like the one Siri uses. Using a
screen reader without headphones means that anyone nearby can hear
what the userâs phone is saying, which can reveal sensitive
information like the phone numbers of people who call or text the
person, user passwords, and even the pass code to their phone. This
means that headphones are quite necessary. Some blind people own
Braille displays, which gets output from a screen reader and displays
it in braille, but these devices are expensive, starting at $600, up
to near $6000, so are out of most blind peopleâs price ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless headphones, using Bluetooth, often have large lags when being
used. If you play a game using them, youâll surely notice it. A blind
person who uses Bluetooth headphones must deal with that for all
interactions with the phone. Imagine having to deal with a phone with
a screen that lags behind what youâre doing on the phone, even by 300
Milliseconds. Some Bluetooth headphones are better, but none can match
wired ones. Appleâs Airpods 2 and Airpods Pro come closer, but have
their own problems: they still must be charged, have lesser battery
life, and cost much for the sound quality they come with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve all of these problems, I have bought a $10 Lightning to 3.5
Millimeter Headphone adapter, and use that with the headphones that I
already have. Sure, I have to take my iPhone with me in my pocket
wherever I go, but I usually do that anyways now that my Apple Watch
is broken also. Sure, I donât have my Lightning connector free, but I
have a charging mat that I use to charge the phone. There is no lag
when using VoiceOver, the sound quality is very good, and I donât have
to charge my headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope is not lost, however. There is a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-13-rumor-wireless-no-lightning-charging-port-2019-12"&gt;rumor&lt;/a&gt; that iPhones could be
completely wireless. Of course, one still must plug the iPhone into a
computer, so it could be like the older MacBook products with a
magnetic spot to plug dongles into. In this case, a third-party dongle
could add the Lightning and headphone jack back to the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Home button and TouchID&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Apple shipped the iPhone X, the first iPhone without a home
button. This was meant to extend the iPhoneâs screen completely across
the bottom of the screen, even though they had to notch the screen at
the top. Along with the removal of the home button, they added FaceID.
This replaced TouchID as the authentication method for unlocking the
device in general usage of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most users do not have a problem with FaceID. They raise the phone to
look at it, and as they look at the camera, the phone unlocks. They
can then swipe the lock screen away from the bottom, revealing the
home screen. For sighted users, this is a quick, easy, and intuitive
motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For blind people, it isnât so simple. We do not have to look at our
phones in order to use them. In fact, users with braille displays or
hardware, Bluetooth keyboards, do not have to touch their phone. These
users can easily and quickly enter their pass codes, however, so they
usually are not effected by this. Most users must pick up the phone,
wait for the unlock sound from the screen reader, then put it back
down on the surface they were using it on before. If FaceID doesnât
work, they must angle the phone away and back again for another try.
if it fails a few more times, they must enter their pass code,
with headphones in, if they seek to preserve their privacy around
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope is not lost, however. There is a &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/iphone-9"&gt;rumor&lt;/a&gt; that a new iPhone SE type
device, the iPhone 9, could be released this year with a home button,
TouchID, and still sport the A13 CPU. This would be something that I
myself may purchase, as I doubt there will be much greater features in
the iPhone 12, released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appleâs software usually comes last in reviews. Reviewers may talk
about the smooth animations, camera machine learning effects, or
updates to apps. For users of Appleâs accessibility services, however,
software is the core experience of a device, and what sets MacOS apart
from Windows and Linux, and iOS apart from Android. I have covered
Appleâs accessibility options extensively &lt;a href="https://geeksmodo.com/apples-accessibility-consistency/"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, so I will use
this section to highlight parts of software which effect accessibility
indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gatekeeper on MacOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a pro machine, the Mac lately has become a mess of confirmation
dialog boxes and hindrances to opening software not blessed by Apple or
its notarization process. For most users, even most blind users, this
wonât be much of an issue. If you use Appleâs apps, or apps from the
App Store, youâll be fine. But what happens when you want to use, say,
Emacs for editing text, or Retroarch for playing video games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind people sometimes use specialized software to complete tasks. We
use apps on our phones for recognizing pictures, money, and images of
text, since these are not usually accessible to us. On the Mac, I use
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; for editing text, using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak"&gt;Emacspeak&lt;/a&gt; extension, because I find
it much easier and more enjoyable than Text Edit, Pages, and other
alternatives. In fact, I am using Emacs right now, to write, and
publish, this blog post. However, this program is not notarized by
Appleâs processes, so instead of just being able to open it, I must
open it from the contextual menu, press âCancel,â then open it again,
and press âOpen.â My laptop is a pro machine; I should be treated as a
professional. These features, as with the Touch Bar, should be left to
MacBook Air users, or left for iPad users, when, or if, the iPad
becomes a general-purpose computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, Iâve explored how some of Appleâs decisions across
its ecosystem have effected accessibility. Hardware has changed much,
with software mainly being usable besides accessibility bugs and
overbearing security. More about direct accessibility in software and
services can be found in other articles. Other, smaller issues include
the lack of Apple Stores is smaller cities, turning on iPhone not
producing a vibration, sound, or other way for a blind person to
immediately know when it has turned on, and the Macâs startup chime
disabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what do you think, readers? Iâd love to have your feedback, and
thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>apple</category><category>blindness</category><category>tech</category><guid>https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-03-27-apple-ecosystem/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 16:40:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>quick apple update</title><link>https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-03-03-quick-apple-update/</link><dc:creator>Devin Prater</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-03-03-quick-apple-update/%7B%%20link%0A_posts/2020-02-13-accessibility-consistency.md%20%%7D"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I
talked about Apple having a few problems to fix. Last month, they
fixed one of them, being Apple Research. The hearing study now will
have accessible hearing tests and questions. Focus is still a little
jumpy in the Heart and Movement study questions, and my watch screen
has become a moving part so I canât participate in that study
completely, or track my sleep accurately, but getting transportation
to the Apple Store is something Iâve covered well on Twitter already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thanks so much to the people at Apple who handled the Research
accessibility to this point, and may it become even better, reversing
the trend started with the inaccessibility of Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>apple</category><category>blindness</category><category>tech</category><guid>https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-03-03-quick-apple-update/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 03:43:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>text formatting for the blind</title><link>https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-02-23-text-formatting-for-the-blind/</link><dc:creator>Devin Prater</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text formatting is used in many areas, from books, newspapers,
articles, websites, and documents. Paragraphs, headings, lists,
italics, bold, and many other characteristics are used to emphasize,
denote chapters, and mark changes in scenes or actions. Sighted users
can use formatting to find points of interest in text. What about
people who are blind? Is formatting effective for us? Can it be
useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will explore text formatting, and how blind people
use it or dismiss it. Like all of my other articles, this one will
contain opinions. This area is one that I feel should be discussed,
however, because it is an area of inclusion that I feel blind people
have ignored, and sighted people havenât generally approached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text formatting is pretty much just information about text to a
computer. A bolded word, an italicized title, a heading line, or a
list of items are all ways of formatting. Sighted people see all this
in the context of their chosen font, but screen readers only read, by
default, a small set of textual attributes, and only by describing
what the attribute is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a screen reader user turns on the reading of styles or formatting,
the screen reader will, italics on describe italics off, the
formatting, which can become verbose, and sometimes doesnât help
because the screen reader doesnât pause after speaking formatting
characteristics, meaning that the user has to quickly parse what the
screen reader is saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is that it? Is the only choice for a user to hear little to no
formatting information, or hear it all in a quick procession of words?
There are other options, better in fact than anything done by most
visual interfaces so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How blind people format text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind people have a few ways of formatting text. The visual method
requires users to press a command, write their text, press the command
again, and review formatting with the screen reader. Braille allows
blind people to feel formatting, if supported by the screen reader.
Markup languages allow blind people to type formatting symbols around
text, which they can review with normal text navigation functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visual&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular way of formatting for sighted users, choosing a
formatting attribute from a tool bar, is also how blind people format,
most of the time, using keyboard commands. It is easy because it is
familiar. All word processors support this, using similar keyboard
commands for bold, italics, underline, and indentation. Some word
processors, like LibreOffice on Windows, do not speak when these
keyboard commands are pressed, so users have to trust in their
keyboarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this approach is that one has to turn on the reading
of font information, like styles, for a screen reader user to be sure
when a particular formatting style begins and ends, and that a program
may not speak when formatting commands are pressed. Screen readers do,
usually, read headings and lists without needing settings changes, but
thatâs about all. JAWS for Windows can be configured to &lt;a href="https://doccenter.freedomscientific.com/doccenter/doccenter/rs25c51746a0cc/2012-06-20_TextFormatting/02_TextFormatting.htm"&gt;speak or play
sounds&lt;/a&gt;
for formatting, but most users do not realize that this feature is
available, and so it is not used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all is lost, however. Narrator now has the ability to read
formatting using different speech settings, like a change in pitch,
volume, or rate. VoiceOver on the Mac can "beep" for formatting
changes, although that doesnât tell us &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; formatting information
was used. NVDA has begun working on refactoring its speech system, so
in the future, NVDA may be able to do what Narrator does, and more.
Imagine hearing sounds for each text attribute, instead of even having
vocal indications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Braille&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braille is a tactile way of reading, and has plenty of standards for
showing formatting. If you get a book from a library in braille, it is
likely to have been formatted very well. Reading braille via screen
reader, however, is often a bland experience, with little to no
formatting information. Screen readers do show abbreviated symbols for
item types like headings, lists, and links, but not italics, bold,
underline, or anything else. One can use Status Cells, dots at the end
of a display used in a few screen readers to show text attributes, but
these are imprecise, as a formatted word would show, on that status
cell, as if the whole line were formatted. iOS uses this technique.
The largest problem with this is that there are standard braille
symbols for formatting, supported by the
&lt;a href="http://liblouis.org"&gt;Liblouis&lt;/a&gt; translator at least; they simply
arenât used. In Safari, formatted text is often placed in its own
item, but that still doesnât tell us &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; text attribute was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only screen reader that currently shows any text formatting is
NVDA. It can show emphasized text, but thatâs all Iâve found. It used
to show more, and why it doesnât now I donât know. The Braille
Extender addon adds the ability for NVDA to show paragraph
indentation. All other screen readers just show words, just like
speech, without any trace of formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Text Markup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text markup languages, like &lt;a href="https://commonmark.org"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://orgmode.org"&gt;Org-mode&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; allow the user to write a
document, web page, blog post, or book using formatting that anyone
can read. Screen readers may need to be set to speak most punctuation,
and in the case of Markdown and Org-mode, set to repeat more than
three characters. This is even used in contexts where it is not
supported, like Email, forum posts, and texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of formatting, for now, is the most accessible. It can be
read using speech or braille, and can often be previewed in a browser
or other format if a user isnât confident in using the markup style.
Because of this level of accessibility, I believe that Markdown, or
even better, Org-mode, should be a part of text editing, everywhere,
in all operating systems. A user could write in Markdown, and the text
would visually be formatted, allowing all those *italics* to not go
to waste. If you use Emacs with
&lt;a href="http://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/"&gt;Emacspeak&lt;/a&gt;, you hear formatting
when reading websites, Markdown and Org-mode files, and syntax
highlighting with source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why blind people dismiss formatting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are sighted, imagine a world with no formatting. No italics, no
bold, no underline, just some headings, lists, and block quotes, all
practically the same, and absolutely no color. This is, even using
braille display, what blind people get. There arenât even any separate
paragraphs, just chunks of text on mobile and Mac, and one long page
with some headings for division on Windows. Would you enjoy this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are blind, you already know this world, and probably donât
consider the possibility that at least one word on this page is
italicized, because for you, there is no formatting; it simply doesnât
exist. Blind people donât particularly like formatting because we
canât really use it on the most popular system, Windows, with the most
popular screen readers, NVDA and JAWS, without much frustration. We
donât dismiss it because we  donât like the idea, we dismiss it
because we donât have access to that information, and donât see the
uses for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How formatting can be useful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letâs start with the obvious. Headings can mark chapters of a book,
sections of an article, and allow quick navigation through a page for
blind people. Lists are useful for itemizing content. Block quotes
are useful for long quotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the more invisible formatting, at least for blind people?
Italics is great for &lt;em&gt;emphasizing&lt;/em&gt; things, bold makes things stand
out, and underlining is good for making something notable. If screen
readers spoke these things using differing speech parameters, or even
sounds, Iâm sure that most blind people would find that they add some
color to our Grey, lifeless text, and make things we write look much
better to sighted readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, reader? Do you care about formatting enough to use
&lt;a href="https://pandoc.org"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; on just about every Word document, like
me, in order to see formatting? Would you rather not know about
formatting on your favorite websites? If you can see, do you not
really notice formatting, or do you find it essential and beautiful?
Please, let me know. Iâd love to hear your feedback, whether it come

and how other tech companies with commitments to accessibility, like
Microsoft and Google, compare to Apple in their accessibility efforts.
It also shows where these companies can improve their consistency, and
that no company is perfect at being an Assistive Technology provider
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has shown a commitment to
&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/"&gt;accessibility&lt;/a&gt; since the early
days of the iPhone, and since mac OSX Tiger. Its VoiceOver screen reader
was the first built-in screen reader of any usability on a personal
computer and smart phone. Now, VoiceOver is on every Apple product, even
the HomePod. It is so prevalent that people I know have begun calling
any screen reader âVoiceOver.â This level of consistency should be
congratulated in a company of Appleâs size and wealth. But is this a
continual trend, and what does this mean for competitors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an opinion piece. I will not stick only to the facts as we
have them, and wonât give sources for everything which I show as fact.
This article is a testament to how accessibility can be made a
fundamental part of a brandâs experience for effected people, so
feelings and opinions will be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The trend of accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following sections of the article will explore companies trends of
accessibility so far. The focus is on Apple, but Iâll also show some of
what its competitors have done over the years as well. As Apple has a
greater following of blind people, and Applevis has documented so much
of Appleâs progress, I can show more of it than I can its competitors,
whose information written by their followers are scattered, thus harder
to search for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has a history of accessibility, shown by &lt;a href="http://maccessibility.net/2011/02/10/blind-faith-a-decade-of-apple-accessibility"&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;.
Written just under a decade ago, it goes over the previous decadeâs
advancements. As that article has done, I will focus on little of a
companyâs talk of accessibility, but more so its software releases and
services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is, by numbers and satisfaction, the leader in accessibility for
users of its mobile operating systems, but not in general purpose
computer operating systems. Microsoftâs Windows is used far more than
Appleâs MacOS. Besides that, and services, Apple has made its VoiceOver
screen reader on iOS much more powerful, and even flexible, than its
competitor, Googleâs TalkBack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As iPhones were released each year, so were newer versions of iOS. In
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-accessibility-ios-6"&gt;iOS 6&lt;/a&gt;,
accessibility settings began working together, VoiceOverâs Rotor gained
a few new abilities, new braille displays worked with VoiceOver, and
bugs were fixed. In
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-and-changed-blind-and-low-vision-users-ios-71"&gt;iOS 7&lt;/a&gt;,
we gained the ability to have more than one high quality voice, more
Rotor options, and the ability to write text using handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next,
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-ios-8-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users"&gt;iOS 8&lt;/a&gt;
was pretty special to me, personally, as it introduced the method of
writing text that I almost always use now, Braille Screen Input. This
lets me type on the screen of my phone in braille, making my typing
exponentially faster. Along with typing, I can delete text, a word or
character, and now, send messages from within the input mode. I can also
change braille contraction levels, and lock orientation into one of two
typing modes. Along with this, Apple added the Alex voice, its most
natural yet, which was only before available on a Mac. For those who do
not know braille or handwriting, a new âdirect touch typingâ method
allows a user to type as quickly as a sighted person, if they can
memorize exactly where the keys are, or have spell check and
autocorrection enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-and-changed-ios-9-accessibility-blind-and-deaf-blind-users"&gt;iOS 9&lt;/a&gt;,
VoiceOver users are able to choose Siri voices to speak using VoiceOver,
as an extension of the list of Vocalizer voices, and Appleâs Alex voice.
One can now control speech rate more easily, and the speed of speech can
be greater than previously possible. One can control the time a double
tap should take, a better method of selecting text, braille screen input
improvements, and braille display fixes and new commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then,
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/what-s-new-ios-10-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users"&gt;iOS 10&lt;/a&gt;
arrived, with a new way to organize apps, a pronunciation dictionary,
even more voices, reorganized settings, new sounds for actions, a way to
navigate threaded email, and some braille improvements. One great thing
about the pronunciation editor is that it does not only apply to the
screen reader, as in many Windows screen readers, but to the entire
system speech. So, if you use VoiceOver, but also Speak Screen, both
will speak as you have set them to. This is a testament to Appleâs
attention to detail, and control of the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-ios-11-accessibility-blind-low-vision-and-deaf-blind-users"&gt;iOS 11&lt;/a&gt;,
we gained the ability to type to Siri, new Siri voices, verbosity
settings, the ability to have subtitles read or brailled, and the
ability to change the speaking pitch of the voice used by VoiceOver.
VoiceOver can now describe some images, which will be greatly expanded
later. We can now find misspelled words, which will also be expanded
later. One can now add and change commands used by braille displays,
which, yes, will be expanded upon later. A few things which havenât been
expanded upon yet are the ability to read formatting, however imprecise,
with braille âstatus cells,â and the âreadingâ of Emoji. Word wrap and a
few other braille features were also added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, in
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/apple-releases-ios-12-bringing-new-and-enhanced-features-and-performance-improvements"&gt;iOS 12&lt;/a&gt;,
Apple added commands to jump to formatted text for braille display
users, new Siri voices, verbosity options, confirmation of rotor actions
and sent messages, expansion of the âmisspelledâ rotor option for
correcting the misspelled word, and the ability to send VoiceOver to an
HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, In
&lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/whats-new-ios-13-accessibility-individuals-who-are-blind-or-deaf-blind"&gt;iOS 13&lt;/a&gt;,
Apple moved accessibility to the main settings list, out of the General
section, provided even more natural Siri voices, haptics for VoiceOver,
to aid alongside, or replace, the sounds already present, and the
ability to modify or turn them off. A âvertical scroll barâ has also
been added, as another method of scrolling content. VoiceOver can now
give even greater suggestions for taking pictures, aligning the camera,
and with the iPhone 11, what will be in the picture. One can also
customize commands for the touch screen, braille display, and keyboard,
expanding the ability braille users already had. One can even assign
Siri shortcuts to a VoiceOver command, as Mac users have been able to do
with Apple Script. One can now have VoiceOver interpret charts and
graphs, either via explanations of data, or by an audible representation
of them. This may prove extremely useful in education, and for
visualizing data of any type. Speaking detected text has improved over
the versions to include the detecting of text in unlabeled controls, and
now can attempt to describe images as well. Braille users now have
access to many new braille tables, like Esperanto and several other
languages, although braille no longer switches languages along with
speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MacOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacOS has not seen so much improvement in accessibility over the years.
VoiceOver isnât a bad screen reader, though. It can be controlled using
a trackpad, which no other desktop screen reader can boast. It can be
used to navigate and activate items with only the four arrow keys. It
uses the considerable amount of voices available on the Mac and for
download. It simply isnât updated nearly as often as VoiceOver for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSX 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9 have seen a few new features, like more
VoiceOver voices, braille improvement, and other things. I couldnât find
much before Sierra, so weâll start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sierra, Apple added VoiceOver commands for controlling volume, to
offset the absence of the physical function keys in new MacBook models.
VoiceOver can also now play a sound for row changes in apps like Mail,
instead of interrupting itself to announce âone row added,â because
Appleâs speech synthesis server on the Mac doesnât innately support a
speech queue. This means that neither does VoiceOver, so interruptions
must be worked around. Some announcements were changed, HTML content
became web areas, and interaction became âinâ and âout ofâ items. There
were also bug fixes in this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In High Sierra, one can now type to Siri, VoiceOver can now switch
languages when reading multilingual text, as VoiceOver on the iPhone has
been able to do since iOS 5 at least, improved braille editing and PDF
reading support, image descriptions, and improved HTML 5 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/new-features-changes-and-accessibility-bugs-macos-mojave-blind-and-low-vision-users"&gt;MacOS
Mojave&lt;/a&gt;,
Apple added the beginning of new iPad apps on Mac. These apps work
poorly with VoiceOver, even still in Catalina. There were no new
reported VoiceOver features in this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, In &lt;a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/new-features-changes-improvements-and-bugs-macos-catalina-blind-and-low-vision-users"&gt;MacOS
Catalina&lt;/a&gt;,
Apple added more control of punctuation, and XCode 11âs text editor is
now a little more accessible, even though the Playgrounds function
isnât, and the Books app can now, after years of being on the Mac, be
used for basic reading of books. Braille tables from iOS 13 are also
available in MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The future of Apple accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these changes, however, were discovered by users. Apple doesnât
really talk about all of its accessibility improvements, just some of
the highlights. While I see great potential in accessible diagrams and
graphs, Apple didnât mention this, and users had to find this.
Subsequently, there may be fixes and features that we still havenât
found, three versions of iOS 13 later. Feedback between Apple and its
customers has never been great, and this is only to Appleâs detriment.
Since Apple rarely responds to little feedback, users feel that their
feedback doesnât mean anything, so they stop sending it. Also of note is
that on VoiceOverâs &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/"&gt;Mac accessibility
page&lt;/a&gt;, the âImproved
PDF, web, and messages navigationâ section is from macOS 10.13, two
versions behind what is currently new in VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point is that services havenât been the most accessible. Chief
among them is Apple Arcade, which &lt;a href="https://applevis.com/forum/apple-arcade-anyone"&gt;has no accessible
games&lt;/a&gt;, so far. Apple
research, Iâve found, has some questions which have answers that are
simply unlabeled buttons. While Apple TV Plus has audio description for
all of their shows, this is a minor glimmer of light, shrouded by the
inaccessibility of Apple Arcade, which features, now, over one hundred
games, none of which I can play with any success. In all fairness, a
blind person who is patient may be able to play a game like Dear Reader,
which has some accessible items, but the main goal of that game is to
find a word in a different color and correct it, which is completely at
odds with complete blindness, but could be handled using speech
parameter changes, audio cues, or other signals of font, color, or style
changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if this new direction, no responsibility for not only
other developersâ work, but also the Mac and work done by other
developers and flaunted by Apple, will become the norm. After all, Apple
Arcade is an entire Tab of the App Store; inaccessibility is in plain
view. As a counterpoint, the first iPhone software, and even the second
version, was inaccessible to blind people, but now the iPhone is the
most popular smart phone, in developed nations, for blind people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps next year, Apple Arcade will have an accessible game or two. I
can only hope that this outcome comes true, and not the steady stepping
back of Apple from one of their founding blocks: accessibility. We
cannot know, as no one at Apple tells us their plans. We arenât the only
ones, though, as mainstream technology media shows. We must grow
accustom to waiting on Apple to show new things, and reacting
accordingly, but also providing feedback, and pushing back against
encroaching inaccessibility and decay of macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appleâs competitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I compare operating systems. To me, an operating
system is the root of all software, and thus, the root of all digital
accessibility. With this in mind, the reader may see why it is
imperative that the operating system be as accessible, easy and
delightful to use, and promote productivity as much as possible.
Microsoft and Google are the largest competitors of Apple in the closed
source operating system space, so they are what I will compare Apple to
in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is the main contributor to the Android and Chromium projects.
While both are open source, both are simply a base to be worked from,
not the end result. Not even Googleâs phones run âpureâ Android, but
have Google services and probably other things on the phone as well.
Both, though, have varying accessibility as well. While Apple pays great
attention to its mobile operating systemâs accessibility, Google does
not seem to put many resources towards that. However, its Chrome OS,
which is used much in education, is much more easily accessible, and
even somewhat of an enjoyable experience for a lite operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Android&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android was released one year after iOS. TalkBack was released as part
of Android 1.6. Back then, it only supported navigation via a keyboard,
trackpad, or scroll ball. It wasnât until version 4 when touch screen
access was implemented into TalkBack for phones, and up to this day,
only supports commands done with one finger, two finger gestures being
passed through to Android as one finger commands. TalkBack has worked
around this issue by recently, in Android version 8, gaining the ability
to use the finger print sensor, if available, as a gesture pad for
setting options, and the ability the switch spoken language, if using
Google TTS, when reading text in more than one language. TalkBack uses
graphical menus for setting options otherwise, or performing actions,
like deleting email. It can be used with a Bluetooth keyboard. By
default, it uses Google TTS, a lower quality, offline version of speech
used for things like Google Translate, Google Maps, and the Google Home.
TalkBack cannot use the higher quality Google TTS voices. Instead,
voices from other vendors are downloaded for more natural sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrailleBack, discussed &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/3535226"&gt;on its Google Support
page&lt;/a&gt;,
is an accessibility service which, when used with TalkBack running,
provides rudamentary braille support to Android. Commands are rugged,
meaningless, and unfamiliar to users of other screen readers, and
TalkBackâs speech cannot be turned off while using Brailleback, meaning
that, as one person helpfully provided, that one must plug in a pair of
headphones and not wear them, or turn down the phoneâs volume, to gain
silent usage of oneâs phone using braille. Silent reading is one of
brailleâs main selling points, but accessibility, if not given the
resources necessary, can become a host of workarounds. Furthermore,
brailleback must be installed onto the phone, providing another barrier
to entry for many deaf-blind users, so some simply buy iPods for braille
if they wish to use an Android phone for customization or contrarian
reasons, or simply stick with the iPhone as most blind people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, many have moved to a new screen reader created by a Chinese
developer, called Commentary. This screen reader does, however, have the
ability to &lt;a href="https://www.inclusiveandroid.com/content/commentary-screen-reader-decrypts-your-phone-if-you-have-full-encryption-turned"&gt;decrypt your
phone&lt;/a&gt;
if you have encryption enabled. For braille users,
&lt;a href="https://brltty.app"&gt;BRLTTY&lt;/a&gt; is used for braille usage. This level of
customization, offset by the level of access which apps have to do
anything they wish to your phone, is an edge that some enjoy living on,
and it does allow things like third-party, and perhaps better screen
readers, text to speech engines, apps for blind people like &lt;a href="https://www.seeingwithsound.com"&gt;The
vOICe&lt;/a&gt;, which gives blind people
artificial vision, and other gray area apps like emulators, which iOS
will not accept on the App Store. Users who are technically inclined do
tend to thrive on Android, finding workarounds a joy to find and use,
whereas people who are not, or are but do not want to fiddle with apps
to replace first-party apps which do not meet the needs of the user, and
unoptimized settings, find themselves doing more configuring of the
phone than using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third party offerings, like launchers, mail apps, web browsers, file
managers, all have variable accessibility, which can change from version
to version. Therefore, one must navigate the shifting landscape of first
party tools which may sort of be good enough, third party tools which
are accessible enough but may not do everything you need, and tools
which users have found workarounds for using them. Third party speech
synthesizers are also hit or miss, with some not working at all, others,
like Eloquence, being now unsupported, and more, like ESpeak, sounding
unnatural. The only good braille keyboard which is free hasnât been
updated in years, and Google has not made one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all this, it is safe to say that Android can be a powerful
tool, but has not attained the focus needed to become a great
accessibility tool as well. Google has begun locking down its operating
system, taking away some things that apps could do before. This may come
to inhibit third party tools which blind people now use to give Android
better accessibility. I feel that it is better to have been on iOS,
where things are locked down much, but you have, at least somewhat, a
clear expectation of fairness on Appleâs part. Android is not a big
income source for Google, so Google does not have to answer to app
developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chrome OS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome OS is Googleâs desktop operating system, running Chrome as the
browser, with support for running Android apps. Its accessibility has
improved plenty over the years, with ChromeVox gaining many features
which make it a good screen reader. You can &lt;a href="http://www.chromevox.com"&gt;read more about
chromeVox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main successes to ChromeVox is its braille support. It is
normal for most first-party screen readers to support braille nowadays.
When one plugs in a braille display to a Chromebook with ChromeVox
enabled, ChromeVox begins using that display automatically, if it is
supported. The surprise here is that if one plugs it in when ChromeVox
is off, ChromeVox will automatically turn on, and begin using the
display. This is beyond what other screen readers can do. ChromeVox, and
indeed TalkBack, do not yet support scripting, editing punctuation and
pronounciation speech, and do not have âactivitiesâ as VoiceOver for iOS
and Mac have, but ChromeVox feels much more polished and ready for use
than TalkBack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The future of Google accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the past, Google may add a few more features to TalkBack, but
less than Apple adds to iOS. They have much to catch up on, however, as
they have only two years ago added the ability for TalkBack to detect
and switch languages, and use the finger print sensor like VoiceOverâs
rotor. I have not seem much change over the two years since, except
making a mode for tracking focus from a toggle to a mandatory feature. I
suspect that, in time, they will remove the option to disable explore by
touch, if theyâve not already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Chrome OS, and Google Chrome in general, I hope that the future
brings better things, now that Microsoft is involved in Chromium
development. It could become even more tied to web standards. Perhaps
ChromeVox will gain better sounding offline voices than Androidâs lower
quality Google TTS ones, or gain sounds performed using spacial audio
for deeper immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microsoft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft makes only one overarching operating system, with changes for
XBox, HoloLens, personal computers, and other types of hardware. Windows
has always been the dominant operating system for general purpose
computing for blind people. It hasnât always been accessible, and it is
only in recent years that Microsoft have actively turned their attention
to accessibility on Windows and XBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Windowsâ accessibility increases with each update, and Narrator
becomes a more useful screen reader. I feel that, in a year or so, blind
people may be trained to use Narrator instead of other screen readers on
Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Windows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Windows, there were many different screen readers
competing for dominance.
&lt;a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/"&gt;JAWS&lt;/a&gt;, Job
Access with Speech, was the most dominant, with
&lt;a href="https://www.gwmicro.com/Window-Eyes/"&gt;Window-Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, now abandoned, as
second. They gathered information from the graphics card to describe
what was on the screen. There were no accessibility interfaces back
then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, when
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Active_Accessibility"&gt;MSAA&lt;/a&gt;,
Microsoft Active Accessibility, was created, Window-Eyes decided to lean
on that, while JAWS continued to use video intercept technology to
gather information. In Windows 2000, Microsoft shipped a basic screen
reader, Narrator. It wasnât meant to be a full, useful screen reader,
but one made so that a user could set up a more powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32"&gt;UI
Automation&lt;/a&gt;,
which is still not a very mature product, as screen readers are still
not using it for everything, like Microsoft Office. GW Micro, makers of
Window-eyes, bonded with AI Squared, producers of the ZoomText
magnifier, which was bought by Freedom Scientific, whom promptly
abandoned Window-eyes. These days, JAWS is being taken on by
&lt;a href="https://www.nvaccess.org"&gt;NVDA&lt;/a&gt;, Nonvisual Desktop Access, a free and
&lt;em&gt;open source&lt;/em&gt; screen reader, and Microsoftâs own Narrator screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Windows 8, Microsoft began adding features to Narrator. Now, in
Windows 10, four years later, Narrator has proven itself useful, and in
some situations, helpful in ways that all other screen readers have not
been. For example, one can install, setup, and begin using Windows 10
using Narrator. Narrator is the only self-described screen reader which
can, with little configuration, show formatting not by describing it,
but by changing its speech parameters to âshowâ formatting by sound. The
only other access technology which does this automatically is
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak"&gt;Emacspeak&lt;/a&gt;, the âcomplete audio
desktop.â Its braille support must be downloaded and installed, for now,
but is still better than Androidâs support. Narrator cannot, however,
use a laptopâs trackpad for navigation. Instead, Microsoft decided to
add such spacial navigation to touchscreens, meaning that a user must
reach up and feel around a large screen, instead of using the level
trackpad as a smaller, more manageable area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of support, Microsoftâs support system is better in a few ways.
First, unlike Apple, their feedback system allows more communication
between the community and Microsoft developers. Users can comment on
issues, and developers can ask questions, a bit like on Github. Windows
Insider builds come with announcements by Microsoft with what is new,
changed, fixed, and broken. If anything changes regarding accessibility,
it is in the release notes. Microsoft is vocal about what is new in
accessibility of Windows, in an era when many other companies seem
almost ashamed to mention it in release notes. This is much better than
Appleâs silence on many builds of their beta software, and no notice of
accessibility improvements and features at all. Microsoftâs transparency
is a breath of fresh air to me, as I am much more confident in their
commitment to accessibility for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their commitment, however, doesnât seem to pervade the whole company.
The Microsoft Rewards program is hard to use for me, and contains
quizzes where answers must be dragged and dropped. This may be fun for
sighted users, but I cannot do them with any level of success, so they
arenât fun for me at all. Another problem is the quality of speech.
While Apple has superb speech options like Macintalk Alex, Vocalizer, or
the Siri voices, Microsoftâs offline voices sound bored, pause for too
long, and have a robotic buzzing sound as they speak. I think that a
company of Microsoftâs size could invest in better speech technology, or
make their online voices available for download for offline use.
Feedback has been given about this issue, so perhaps the next version of
Windows will have more pleasant speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows has a few downsides, though. It doesnât support sound through
its Linux subsystem, meaning I cannot use Emacs, with Emacspeak.
Narrator does not yet report when a program opens, or when a new window
appears, and other visual system events. Many newer Universal Windows
apps can be tricky to navigate, and the Mail app still automatically
expands threads as I arrow to them, which I do not want to happen,
making the mail app annoying to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The future of Microsoft accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the future of Microsoft, regarding accessibility, is very
bright. They seem dedicated to the cause, seeking feedback much more
aggressively than Apple or Google, and many in the blind community love
giving it to them. Windows will improve further, possibly with Narrator
gaining the ability to play interface sounds in immersive audio using
Windows Sonic for Headphones, braille becoming a deeper, and built in
part of Narrator, and higher quality speech made available for download.
Since Microsoft is also a gaming company, it could work on creating
sound scapes for different activities: browsing the web, writing text,
coding, reading, to aid in focus or creativity. Speech synthesis could
be given even more parameters for speaking even more types of formatting
or interface item types. really, with Microsoftâs attention to feedback,
I feel that their potential is considerable for accessibility. Then
again, it is equally possible that Apple will implement these features,
but they arenât as inviting as Microsoft when it comes to sharing what
Iâd &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; in an operating system as Microsoft has been, so I now just
report bugs, not giving Apple new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be interesting to note the symmetry of accessibility: Appleâs
phone is the dominant phone, but Microsoftâs Windows platform is the
dominant laptop and desktop system among blind people. Appleâs iPhone is
more accessible than Googleâs Android, but Googleâs Chrome OS is more
polished and updated accessibility-wise than Appleâs MacOS. Personally,
I use a Mac because of its integration with iOS Notes, Messages, Mail,
and other services, the Mail app is a joy to breeze through email with,
and open source tools like Emacs with Emacspeak do not work as well on
Windows. Also, speech matters to me, and Iâd probably fall asleep much
more often hearing Microsoftâs buzzing voices than the somewhat
energetic sound of Alex on the Mac, who speaks professionally, calmly,
and never gets bored. I do, however, use Windows for heavy usage of the
web, especially Google web apps and services, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if companies continue in their paths, Apple forging
ahead, Microsoft burning bright, and Googleâ¦ being Google. I hope,
nevertheless, that this article has been useful for the reader, and that
my opinions have been as fair as possible towards the companies. It
should be noted that the accessibility teams for each company are
individuals, have their own ideas of what accessibility is, means, and
should be, and should be treated with care. After all, this past decade
has been a long journey of, probably, most effort spent convincing
managers that the features we now have are worth spending time on, and
answering user complaints of âmy phone is talking to me and i want it
turned off right now!â.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not excuse them for the decay of Android and Mac
accessibility, and the lack of great speech options on Windows. It does
not excuse them for Apple Arcadeâs lack of accessible games, or
Microsoft Rewardsâ inaccessible quizzes. We must give honest, complete,
and critical feedback to these people. After all, they do not know what
we need, what will be useful, or, if we dare tell, what will be
delightful for us to use, unless we give them this feedback. This
applies to all software, whether it be Appleâs silent gathering of
feedback, Microsoftâs open arms and inviting offers, or open source
softwareâs issue trackers, Discord servers, mailing lists, and Github
repositories. If we want improvement, we must ask for it. If we want a
better future, we must make ourselves heard in the present. Let us all
remember the past, so that we can influence the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what do you think of all this? Do you believe Apple will continue
to march ahead regarding accessibility, or do you think that Microsoft,
or even Google, has something bigger planned? Do you think that Apple is
justified in their silence, or do you hope that they begin speaking more
openly about their progress, at least in release notes? Do you like how
open Microsoft is about accessibility, or do they even talk about
accessibility for blind users enough to you? Iâd love to know your
comments, corrections, and constructive criticism, either in the
comments, on Twitter, or anywhere else you can find me. Thanks so much
for reading!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blindness</category><category>tech</category><guid>https://devinprater.github.io/posts/2020-02-13-accessibility-consistency/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 15:13:23 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
