<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>At the launch of the iPhone 3GS, Apple unveiled VoiceOver on the iPhone. Blind users and accessibility experts had been used to screen readers on computers, and even rudimentary screen readers for smart phones that used a keyboard, trackball, or quadrants of a touch screen for navigation and usage. But here was a screen reader that not only came prepackaged on a modern, relatively inexpensive to the competition, and off-the-shelf device, but it also allowed the user to use the touch screen as it is, a touch device.</p>
<p>This year, VoiceOver added a feature called "VoiceOver recognition." This feature allows VoiceOver to utilize the machine learning coprocessor in newer iPhone models to describe images with near-human quality, make apps more accessible using ML models, and read the text in images.</p>
<p>This article will explore these new features, go into their benefits, compare VoiceOver Recognition to other options, and discuss the history of these features, and what's next.</p>
<h3>VoiceOver Recognition, the features</h3>
<p>VoiceOver Recognition, as discussed before, contains three separate features: Image Recognition, Screen Recognition, and Text recognition. All three work together to bring the best experience. In accessible apps and sites, though, Image and Text recognition do the job fine. All three features must be downloaded and turned on in VoiceOver settings. Image recognition acts upon images automatically, employing Text recognition when text is found in an image.</p>
<p>Screen recognition makes inaccessible apps as good as currently possible with the ML (Machine Learning) model. It is still great, though. It allows me to play Final Fantasy Record Keeper quite easily. It is not perfect, but it is only the beginning!</p>
<h3>Benefits of VoiceOver Recognition</h3>
<p>Imagine, if you are sighted, that you have never seen a picture before, or if you have, that you've never seen a picture you've taken yourself. Imagine that all the pictures you have viewed on social media have been blurry and vague. Sure, you can see some movies, but they are far and few between. And apps? You can only access a few, relative to the number of total apps. And games are laughably simple and forgettable.</p>
<p>That is how digital life is for blind people. Now, however, we have a tool that
helps with that immensely. VoiceOver Recognition gives amazing descriptions for
photos. Not perfect, and sometimes when playing a game, I just get "A photo of a
video game" as a description, but again, this is the first version. And photos
in news articles and on websites, and in apps, are amazingly accurate. If I
didn't know better, I would think someone at Apple is busy describing all the
images I come across. While Screen Recognition can fail spectacularly sometimes,
especially with apps that do not look native to iOS, it has allowed me to get
out of sticky situations in some apps and has allowed me to press the occasional button that VoiceOver can't press due to poor app coding and such.
And I can play a few text-heavy games with it, like Game of Thrones, a tale of
crows.</p>
<p>Even my ability to take pictures is greatly enhanced with image recognition. With this feature, I can open the Camera app, put VoiceOver focus on the "view finder," and it will describe what is in the camera view! When it changes, I must move focus away and back to the View Finder, but that's a small price to pay for a "talking camera" that is actually accurate.</p>
<h3>Comparing VO Recognition to Other Options</h3>
<p>Blind people may then say "Okay, what about Narrator on Windows? It does the same thing, right?" No. First, the photo is sent to a server owned by Microsoft. On iOS, the photo is captioned using the ML Coprocessor. What Microsoft needs and Internet connection and remote server to do, Apple does far better with the chip on your device!</p>
<p>You may then say "Well, how does it give better results?" First, it's automatic. Land on an image, and it works! Second, it is not shy about what it thinks it sees. If it is confident in its description, it will simply describe it. Narrator, and Seeing AI, always say "Image may contain: " before giving a guess. And, with more complex images, Narrator fails, and so does Seeing AI. I have read that this is set to improve, but I've not seen the improvements yet. Only when VoiceOver Recognition isn't confident in what it sees, it says, "Photo contains," and then gives a list of objects that it is surer of. This does not happen nearly as frequently as Narrator/Seeing AI, though.</p>
<p>You may also say "Okay, so how is this better than NVDA's OCR? You can use it to click on items in an app." Yes, and that is great, it really is, and I thank the NVDA developers every time I use VMWare with Linux because there always seems to be something going on with it. But with VoiceOver Recognition, you get an actual natively "accessible," app. You don't have to click on anything, and you know what VoiceOver thinks the item type of something is: a button, text field, ETC., and can interact with the item accordingly. With NVDA, you have a sort of mouse. With VO Recognition, you have an entire app experience.</p>
<h3>The history of these features</h3>
<p>Using AI to bolster the accessibility of user Interfaces is not a new idea. It has been floating around the blind community for a while now. I remember discussing it on an APH (American Printing House for the Blind) mailing list around a decade ago. Back then, however, it was just a toy idea. No one thought it could be done with current, at the time, Android 2.3 era hardware or software. It continued to be brought up by blind people who dreamed bigger than I, but never really went anyway.</p>
<p>Starting with the iPhone X R, Apple began shipping a machine learning Coprocessor within their iPhones. Then n iOS 13, VoiceOver gained the ability to describe images. This was not using the ML chip, however, since older phones could take advantage of it. I thought they may improve this, but I had no idea they would do as great a job as they are doing with iOS 14.</p>
<h4>What's Next?</h4>
<p>As I've said a few times now, this is only version one. I suspect Apple will continue building on their huge success this year, fleshing out Screen recognition, and perhaps having VoiceOver automatically speak what's in the camera view when preparing to take a picture, and perhaps adding even more than I cannot imagine now. I suspect, however, that this is leading to an even larger reveal for accessibility in the next few years, Augmented and Virtual reality. Apple Glasses, after all, would be very useful if they could describe what's around a blind person.</p>

<p>This is basically a test post. I've switched from Emacs to VS Code, and I'll
detail why below. The gist is that Emacs is unhelpful, only easy to set up on Mac
and Linux, and Emacs packages are not standard, and Emacspeak, the speech
extension for Emacs, just can't keep up with extensions like LanguageTool, and
probably won't because coding is Emacs' main use case, not writing.</p>
<h3>Why I used Emacs</h3>
<p>Emacs has been my work tool for about a year now. I went along with its strange
commands, and even got to liking them. I memorized strange terminology in order
to get the most of the editor. Don't get me wrong, Emacs is a wonderful tool,
and Emacspeak allows me to use it with confidence and even enjoyment.</p>
<p>Before the end, I was writing blog posts, both here and on a Wordpress blog,
using Git and GitHub, and even reading EBooks. I also adore Org-mode, which I
still find superior to anything else for note taking, compiling quick reports,
and just about anything writing-related. Seriously, being able to export just
one part of a file, instead of the whole large file containing every bit of
work-related notes, is huge, and I'll now have to use folders, subfolders,
and folders under those to come close to achieving that level of
productivity. And no, the Org-mode extension for VS Code doesn't have a third of
the ability of the native Emacs Org-mode.</p>
<p>But, Emacs was founded on the do-it-yourself mentality, and it'll stay that way.
If you don't know what to look for, Emacs will just sit there, without any
guidance for you. I'll get more into that as I compare it with VS Code.</p>
<h3>Making Good out of Bad</h3>
<p>One day, my MacBook, which is what I run Emacs on, ran very low on battery. It
was in the morning that day, and I have a Windows computer also, so I decided to
see if I could get things done on it. I'd tried writing on it before, using
Markdown in Word, or even VS Code before. But my screen reader, NVDA, wouldn't
read indentation like Emacspeak did, or pause between reading formatting symbols in Markdown like
Emacspeak did, play sounds for quick alerts of action like Emacspeak did, or
even have a settings interface like Emacs did, and definitely didn't have a
voice like Alex on the Mac. Those were my thoughts when I'd tried it before.
I'll tackle them all, now that I've used VS Code for almost a week.</p>
<p>So, I managed to get Markdown support close to how I used it in Emacs, minus the
quick jumping between headings with a single keyboard command. I still miss
that. The LanguageTool extension works perfectly, although I had to learn that
to access the corrections it gave I have to press <strong>Control + . (period)</strong>.
Every extension I've installed so far has worked with NVDA. I cannot say that
for Emacs with Emacspeak. Since the web is so standardized, there isn't too much
an extension could do to not be accessible. Sometimes I wish the suggestions
didn't pop up all the time in some language modes, but I'll take that any day
over inaccessibility.</p>
<p>So, on with debunking the problems I had at first. Hopefully this will help
newcomers to VS Code, or those who are cynical that basically a web app can do
what they need:</p>
<h4>NVDA doesn't read indentation!</h4>
<p>Yes, it can. It can either speak the indentation, or beep, starting at, I
believe, low C for the baseline and moving up tones. Sometimes I have to pay a
bit of attention to notice the difference between no space and one space, but
that's what having it speak is for.</p>
<h4>NVDA doesn't pause between formatting symbols!</h4>
<p>This is true, and unavoidable for now. But, unlike Emacspeak, NVDA has the
ability to use a braille display, which makes reading, digesting information,
and learning a lot easier for those whose mind, like mine, is more like a train
than a race car. In the future, NVDA's speech refactoring may make pausing, or
changing pitch for syntax highlighting, a reality.</p>
<h3>VS Code doesn't play sounds!</h3>
<p>This is true too, and I've not found a setting or extension to make this happen.
Maybe one day...</p>
<h3>VS Code doesn't even have a settings interface!</h3>
<p>Before, I thought one had to edit the JSON file for settings to change them. It
turns out that if you press <strong>Control + , (comma)</strong>, you get a simple, easy,
Windows interface. This is a bit rough around the edges, because you have to Tab
twice from one setting to the next, and you could roam from one section of
settings to another, but it's easier than Emacs.</p>
<h3>But what about the awful Windows voices!</h3>
<p>Yes, Windows voices still are dry and boring, or sound fuzzy, but NVDA has many
options for speech now. I've settled on one that I can live with. No, it doesn't
have the seeming contextual awareness of paragraphs like Alex, but it's Windows.
I can't expect <em>too</em> much.</p>
<h3>Bonus points for VS Code</h3>
<h4>Git</h4>
<p>I'm only now starting to get Git. It's a program that allows you to keep
multiple versions of things, so you can roll back your work, or even work on
separate parts of your work in separate branches of the project. Emacs just...
sits there as usual, assuming you have any idea of what you're doing. VS Code,
though, actively tries to help. If you have Git, it offers an extension for
that. If you open a Git repository, it asks if you'd like it to fetch changes
every once in a while to make sure things are up-to-date when you commit your
changes. I was able to commit a pull request in VS Code easily and with minimal
fuss. In Emacs, I didn't even know where to begin. And any program that takes
guessing and meaningless work off my shoulders is a program I'll keep.</p>
<h4>Suggestions while typing</h4>
<p>VS Code is pretty good at this. If I'm writing code, it will offer suggestions
as I type. Sometimes they're helpful, sometimes they aren't. In text modes, this
doesn't happen; it appears that this only happens in programming modes. Emacs
would just let you type and type and type, and then browsing Reddit you'd find
out about snippet packages that may or may not work with Emacspeak.</p>
<h4>Standardized</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, VS Code is basically a web app. Emacs is a program written
in mostly Emacs Lisp, and a bit written in C. Extensions in VS Code are written
in JavaScript, whereas extensions in Emacs are written in its Lisp dialect.
Since Emacs is completely text based, any kind of fancy interface must be made
manually, which usually means that Emacspeak will not work with it, unless the
author, or a community member, massages the data enough to make it work. This is
a constant battle, and it won't get easier for anyone involved.</p>
<p>VS Code is a graphical tool that has plenty of keyboard commands, and screen
reader support. Its completion, correction, and terminal processes have already
been created, so all extensions have to do is hook into that. This means that a
lot of extensions are accessible, without even knowing it.</p>
<h3>So, any downsides to VS Code?</h3>
<p>VS Code is not perfect by any stretch. When screen reader support is enabled, a
few features are actually disabled because Microsoft doesn't know how to convey
them to the user without using sound. Code folding is disabled, which would make
navigating markdown a lot simpler. Word wrapping is disabled, meaning that a
paragraph is on one very long line. I've found Rewrap, a third-party extension
that I can use, so that's fixed. There are no sounds, so the only way I know
there are problems is by going to the next problem, or opening the issues panel.</p>
<p>Overall though, VS Code has impressed me, and I continuously find wonderful,
time-saving, mind-clearing moments where I breathe a sigh of relief that to
create a list in markdown, I can just select lines of text, and choose “toggle
list” from the commands panel, whereas with Emacs I had to mark the list of
lines and remember some strange command like “string-insert-rectangle” and type
“*” to make all of those list items. These kinds of time-savers make me more
productive, offsetting slightly the lack of features akin to those in Org-mode.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I didn't expect this post to be so long, but it will be a good test to see if VS
Code's Hugo support is enough to replace Easy-Hugo on Emacs. While VS Code
doesn't have a book reader, at least, not one I think I'd like, or a media
player with Tune-In Radio support made for the blind, and many other packages,
it is a great editor, and does have tools like Hugo extensions that make it
slightly more that an editor. I should branch out more and see what tools
Windows now has for these functions anyways. I already use Foobar2000 for media,
I just have to find a good book reader that doesn't get rid of formatting info.</p>
<p>So, I hope you all have enjoyed reading this long test of VS Code, and an update
on what I've been doing lately when not playing video games and other things.</p>
<p>In other news, I've been using the iOS 14 and macOS 11 public betas. I'll report
on my findings on those when the systems are released this fall.</p>

                    <div>
<p>WWDC is Apple's "World Wide Developer Conference." It's where developers
come to learn about what will be new in Apple's operating systems (iOS,
iPad OS, MacOS, ETC.), and learn how to make the best of Apple's walled
garden of tools to program apps. Tech reporters also come to the event,
to gather all the news and distill it into the expected bite-sized,
simple pieces. Be assured, my readers, that I will not hold anything
back from you in my analysis of the event.</p>
<p>WWDC is not here just yet. I know, many news sites are predicting and
yammering and getting all giddy with "what if" excitement. I won't bore
you with such useless speculation just to fill the headlines and
homepages. I fear that I lack the imagination and incentive to create
such pieces. Besides, I'm more interested in what a device can <em>do</em>, and
less about how it looks or feels.</p>
<p>However, I am Invested in Apple's operating systems. I do want to see
Apple succeed in accessibility and think that, if they put enough work
into it, and gave the accessibility team more freedom and staff, that
accessibility would greatly improve. It is in that spirit that I give
you my hopes, not predictions, for WWDC 2020. This "wishlist" will be
separated into headings based on the operating system, and further
divided into subsections of that operating system. After WWDC, I will
revisit this post, and updated it with notes on WWDC if things change on
the wishlist, and then do a post containing more notes and findings from
the event.</p>
<h3>MacOS</h3>
<p>MacOS is Apple's general computer (desktop/laptop) operating system.
With much tried and true frameworks and programs, it is a reliable
system for most people. It even has functions that Windows doesn't, like
the ability to select text anywhere and have that text spoken
immediately, not screen reader needed, and remap keyboard modifier keys,
and system wide spell checking. These help me greatly in all of my work.</p>
<p>Its screen reader is VoiceOver. It's like VoiceOver on the iPhone, but
made for a complex operating system, and has some complex keyboard
commands. Accessibility, like anywhere else, is not perfect on the Mac.
There are bugs that have stood for a long time, and new bugs that I fear
will hang around. There are also features that I'd love to see added, to
make the Mac even better.</p>
<p>In short, MacOS accessibility isn't a toy. I want the Mac to be treated
like it's worth something . From the many bugs, to missing features, the
Mac really needs some love accessibility-wise. Many tech "reporters" say
that the Mac is a grown and stable operating system. For blind people,
though, the Mac is shriveled and stale.</p>
<h4>Catalyst needs an accessibility boost</h4>
<p>"Catalyst" is Apple's bridge between iPad apps and Mac apps. It allows
developers, Apple included, to bring iPad apps to the Mac. Started in
MacOS Mojave with Apple's own apps, Catalyst accessibility was...
serviceable. It wasn't great, but there wasn't anything we couldn't do
with the apps. It just wasn't the best experience. The apps were very
flat, and one needed to use the VoiceOver custom actions menu, without
the ability to use letter navigation, to select actions like one would
using the "actions" rotor on the iPad.</p>
<p>Now, in Catalina, the Catalyst technology is available for third-party
developers, but accessibility issues still remain. The apps don't feel
like Mac apps at all, not even Apple's own apps. So, in MacOS 10.16, I
hope to see at least Apple's own apps be much more accessible,
especially if the Messages app will be an iPad catalyst app.</p>
<h4>VoiceOver needs a queue</h4>
<p>Screen readers convey information through speech, usually. This isn't
new for people who are blind, but what may be new is that they manage
what is spoken using a queue. This means that when you're playing a game
and new text appears, the screen reader doesn't interrupt itself from
speaking the important description of the environment just to speak that
an unimportant NPC just came into the area.</p>
<p>VoiceOver, sadly, does not have this feature, or if it does, it hardly
ever uses it. Now, it looks like the speech synthesis architecture has a
queue <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avspeechsynthesizer">built
in</a>,
so VoiceOver should be using this to great effect. But it isn't. This
means that doing anything complex in the Terminal app is unproductive.
Even using web apps, which have VoiceOver speak events, can be
frustrating when VoiceOver interrupts itself to say \"loading new
tweets\" and such. It was so bad that the VoiceOver team had to give the
option for a sound to play instead of the \"one row added\" notification
for the mail app.</p>
<p>This is a large oversight, and it has gone on long enough. So, in MacOS
10.16, I desperately hope that VoiceOver can finally manage speech like
a true screen reader, with a speech queue.</p>
<h4>Insertion point at... null</h4>
<p>Long time Apple fans may know what the insertion point is. For Windows,
Android, and Linux users, it is the cursor, or Point. It is where you
insert text. On Mac and iOS, VoiceOver calls this the insertion point,
and it appears in text fields. The only problem is, VoiceOver says it
appears on read‐only places, like websites in earlier versions of MacOS
10.15, and emails to this day.</p>
<p>VoiceOver believes that there is an insertion point in the email
somewhere, but says that it is at "null", meaning that it is at 0, or
doesn't exist. That's because there isn't one. This only appears when
you are reading by element, <strong>VO + Right or Left arrow</strong>, and not when
you are reading by line with just the up and down arrows, where there is
a sort of cursor to keep track of where you are. But this cursor is,
most likely, a VoiceOver construct, so it should know that when moving
by element, there practically isn't one besides VoiceOver's own "cursor"
that is focusing on things.</p>
<p>This bug is embarrassing. I wouldn't want my supervisor seeing this kind
of bug in the technology that I use to do professional work. I stress
again that the Mac is <em>not</em> a toy. Yes, it has "novelty" voices, and
yes, some blind people talk like them for fun, or use them in daily work
to be silly. I don't, though, because the Mac is my <strong>work</strong> machine.
What's a computer, Apple asks? A Mac, that's what! I rely on this
computer for my job, and if things don't improve, I'll probably move to
Linux, which is the next best option for my workflow. Of course, things
there don't improve much either, but at least the screen reader is
actually used by its creator and testers, so silly bugs like that don't
appear in a <strong>pro</strong> device. So, in MacOS 10.16, I hope that the
accessibility team took a long vacation from adding stuff and spent a
lot of time on fixing MacOS' VoiceOver so that I can be proud to own a
Mac again.</p>
<h4>I need more fingers</h4>
<p>The Mac has so many keyboard commands, and letter navigation in all
menus and lists make navigating the Mac a breeze. But some of the
keyboard commands were clearly made for a desktop machine. I have a
MacBook Pro, late 2019 with four Thunderbolt ports, but still the same
Function, Control (remapped to escape), Option, Command, Space, Command,
Option, Capslock (remapped to control because Emacs), keyboard layout.
In order to lock the screen, then, with the normal keyboard layout
(without remapping due to the touch bar and Emacs), I'd have to lock the
screen by holding the command key with my right thumb, hold control with
my left pinkie, and... and... how do I reach the Q? Ah, found it! I
think. That may be A, or 1, though.</p>
<p>My point is, we blind people pretty much <strong>always</strong> use the keyboard.
sure, we can use the track pad, but that's an option, not a requirement
like the touch screen of an iPhone. Keyboard commands should be
ergonomic, for every Mac model, not just the iMac. So, in Mac OS 10.16,
I hope to see more ergonomic keyboard commands for MacBooks. I hope
VoiceOver commands become more ergonomic as well, as pressing <strong>Control
+ Option + Command + 2</strong> or even <strong>Capslock + Command + 2</strong> gets pretty
cramped. I know, the Touchbar means less keys, but my goodness I hate
using those commands when I need to. And no, having us use the VoiceOver
menu isn't a fix. It's a workaround. And no, having us use letter
navigation to lock the screen or do any number of hard keyboard commands
is not a fix, it's a workaround.</p>
<h4>Find and replace Touchbar with Function keys</h4>
<p>I've talked about the Touchbar in earlier articles, so I'll just give an
overview here. The Mac does not have a Touchscreen. The Touchscreen is
slower for blind people to use, and so is the Touchbar. We can't even
customize it, as that part of system preferences is seemingly
inaccessible to us. One Mac user said he has answers on how to use it
well, but I asked him about it, and haven't seen a reply to my query.
For now, then, the Touchbar is useless to me, and blind people who, like
me, use their Macs to get work done.</p>
<p>Now, one place it could be good at is in Pages. While in Pages, the
Touchbar acts like a row of formatting buttons. But there are keyboard
commands for almost all of them, except for adding a heading. If the
Touchbar were that useful everywhere else, it may have a place in my
workflow. But I write all of my documents, when I can help it, in
Markdown or Org-mode, inside Emacs or another text editor. So the
Touchbar would be better gone from my MacBook, and replaced by the much
more useful function keys, with tactile buttons that do one thing when
pressed in each context, and I know what they'll do when pressed.</p>
<p>So, in a new model of the MacBook, I want the <strong>option</strong> to use regular
function keys, even if it costs \$20 more. Either that, or give me a
reason to use this useless touch strip that only acts to eliminate keys
that VoiceOver can use and make keyboarding that much more limited. And
no, an external keyboard is not a fix. It's a workaround.</p>
<h4>Text formatting with VoiceOver</h4>
<p>This applies to both MacOS and iOS, but it'd be more useful on the Mac,
so I'm putting it here. As I wrote in my <em>Writing Richly</em> post,
formatting is important for both reading and writing. I did send Apple
feedback based on this, so I hope that in 10.16, I, and all other blind
people, are able to read and write with as much access to formatting as
sighted people.</p>
<h4>What's that window say?</h4>
<p>In MacOS Catalina, Apple added a little‐known feature to VoiceOver: the
ability to get a "caption" from any element, or "control", on the
screen.</p>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<h4>There's nothing on the screen</h4>
<p>There are many iOS apps that are very accessible. They work well with
VoiceOver, and can be used fine by blind people. However, there are also
many which appear blank to VoiceOver, so cannot easily be used.
VoiceOver could use its already‐good text recognition technology to scan
the entire screen if an element cannot be found with an accessible
label, other than the app title. Then, it could get the location of the
scanned text and items, and allow a user to feel around the screen to
find them.</p>
<p>This could dramatically improve access to everything from games, to
utility apps written in an inaccessible framework, like QT. May QT be
forgotten, forever. So, in iOS 14, I hope that Apple majorly ramps up
its use of AI in VoiceOver. Besides, that would put Google, the AI
company, even further to shame, since they don't use AI at all in
TalkBack to recognize inaccessible items or images.</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<h4>Apple Arcade for <em>everyone</em>
</h4>
<p>Apple Arcade came out some time last year. 100 games were promised
around launch time, and at \$5 per month, it is an amazing deal, as you
can play these games forever; there is no rotation like in XBox Game
Pass. For now, though, there have been no games that blind people can
play, so I just canceled my subscription, my hope in Apple dwindling
further. So, in this year's WWDC, I hope that Apple not only adds
accessible games to Apple Arcade, or even makes a few of their own, but
shows them off. People should <em>know</em> that Apple truly cares, as much as
a 1.5 trillion dollar corporation can, about accessibility and people
who are blind, who <em>cannot</em> play regular, inaccessible games.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope this article has enlivened your imagination a bit regarding the
soon‐to‐be WWDC 2020. I've detailed what I want to see in MacOS, my most
often used Apple system, iOS, and Apple's services. Now, what do you
want to see? Please, let me know by commenting wherever this article is
shared.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for reading my articles. If you have any suggestions,
corrections, or other comments, please don't hesitate to reach out to

<p>Coding has always been hard for me. I've never been able to get my mind
around loops, if and else, for and while, and break almost breaks me
instead of the code. However, many people make it look easy, and for
them, it probably is. In iOS 14, Apple may loosen their chains upon
their technology enough for developers to explore the boundaries of what
a pocket computer can do.</p>
<p>Apple is very controlling. All of its operating systems can only run
on its own hardware. Its hardware can only be used to practically run
officially sanctioned operating systems, unless a Linux user can get
passed the security on the Mac. And, for a long time, notwithstanding
workarounds that have never been so easy, apps on iOS have only been
usable if they were downloaded through Apple's own App Store. In iOS
14, however, things may change for the better.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Applevis released a blog post about iOS 14 possibly
gaining <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/apple-reported-be-exploring-ways-let-developers-provide-custom-text-speech-synthesizers-ios">Custom Text to Speech engine
support</a>.
While I won't write about it here, as it seems a minor topic to me, I
will say that this is something that the community of blind people
have been asking for since VoiceOver revolutionized our lives.
Furthermore, though, it is greater evidence that Apple is beginning to
open up, just a tad. it isn't, however, the first time we've seen
Apple open up, a bit, for accessibility reasons. Apple allows us, in
iOS 13, to change VoiceOver commands, and it uses the <a href="http://liblouis.org">Liblouis
braille tables</a> to display languages in Braille
that weren't available before.</p>
<p>In this article, I will discuss and theorize about the availability of
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/21/rumor-mobile-version-of-xcode-for-ipad/">XCode on
iOS</a>,
which is supposedly going to be released this year, and how it can help
people learn to code, bring
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">sideloading</a> to many more
people, and how it can bring emulation in full force to iOS.</p>
<h2>Learning to code on iOS</h2>
<p>As I've said before, coding has never been easy for me. My skills are
still very much at the beginner level. I can write "print" statements in
Python, and maybe in Swift, but languages like Quorum, Java, and C++ are
so verbose and require much more forethought than Python. Swift seems a
bit like Python, although just as complex as Java and more verbose
languages when one becomes more advanced.</p>
<p>With XCode on the Mac, accessibility isn't great. Editing text is okay,
but even viewing output seems impossible on first look, and I'm still
not sure if it can even be done. This means that the <a href="https://books.apple.com/book/id1118575552">Intro to App
development with Swift</a>
Playground materials are inaccessible. This has been verified today with
the XCode 10 version. Sure, we can read the source code, but cannot
directly activate the "next" link to move to the next page. And no,
workarounds are not equal access. Furthermore, neither teachers nor
students should have to look for workarounds to use a course created by
Apple, one of the richest companies in the world, whose accessibility
team is great, for iOS.</p>
<p>Because of this, I expect XCode for iOS will be a new beginning, of
sorts, for all teams who work on it, not just the accessibility team. It
will be a way for new, young developers to come to coding on their
phone, or more probably, their iPad, without the history of workarounds
that many developers on the Mac who are blind know today. It will also
allow blind developers to create powerful, accessible apps. If it is
true that Macs will run Apple's own "A" processor someday, then perhaps
this XCode for iOS will move to the Mac, as Apple TV is attempting to
do. Hopefully, by then, iOS apps on the Mac will actually be usable,
instead of messes, accessibility-wise.</p>
<p>Windows users also cannot currently officially code for iOS. Most blind
users have a Windows computer and an iPhone. Having XCode on iOS will
allow more blind people, who are good at coding, to try their hand at
developing iOS apps. This could also bring more powerful apps,
as blind Windows users are used to the power of programs like
Foobar2000, NVDA addons, and lots of choice.</p>
<p>Another benefit of having XCode on iOS is that, because of the number
of users, there will be even more people working on open source
projects, which they could easily download and import into XCode. For
example, perhaps <a href="https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/11696">PPSSPP User InterFace
accessibility</a> could
be improved, or the Delta emulator could become <a href="https://github.com/rileytestut/DeltaCore/issues/13">completely accessible
and
groundbreaking</a>.
Of course, closed source app development could be aided by this as
well, but it is harder to join, or make, a closed source development
team than it is to contribute to an open source one.</p>
<h2>Sideloading with XCode</h2>
<p>Sideloading is the process of running apps on iOS which are not accepted
by the iOS App Store. These include video game console emulators,
torrent downloaders, and apps which allow users to watch "free" movies
and TV shows. The last set of apps, I agree, shouldn't be on the app
store, but the first two are not illegal, but simply could facilitate
illegal operations; pun intended.</p>
<p>Sideloading can be done in many ways. You can load the XCode project
into XCode for Mac, build it, and send it to your own device. This must
be renewed every seven days, but is the most difficult technically to
do. You can sign up for a third-party app store, which allows you to
download apps which are hosted elsewhere and may not be the latest
version, but there is a good chance that the certificate which they use
to sign the app will be revoked by Apple. Finally, there are a few apps
which automate the signing of apps, and pushes the app to the device.</p>
<p>Two of these methods, however, require a Mac computer. Many people,
especially blind people, only use a Windows computer and an iPhone. This
usually isn't a problem, as most blind people either use their phone for
much of what they do, or use their computer for much of what they do.
However, this means that people who have Windows, but not a Mac, cannot
sideload apps. So, if a blind person creates an extension to alert you
that your screen curtain isn't on, which means that a VoiceOver user
doesn't have a feature enabled so that the screen is blank, that app
cannot be distributed on the App Store, and cannot be sideloaded by
Windows users. And I highly doubt a third-party app store would host
such a niche app.</p>
<h2>Emulating with XCode</h2>
<p>Emulators were once a legal gray area. They allow gamers to play video
games, from game consoles like the Playstation Portable, on computers,
tablets, or phones. They have become legal, however, due to Sony's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp.">lawsuits of emulator
developers</a>.
While emulation is legal, however, downloading games from the Internet,
unless, some say, you own the game, is not. Steve Jobs himself, at the
1999 MacWorld conference, <a href="https://youtu.be/vN2vxYnAZf0?t=5038">showed off an
emulator</a>, one for playing
Playstation games. Now, emulators are not allowed onto the iOS App
Store, unless they have been made by the developers of the games which
are being emulated.</p>
<p>XCode on iOS would also help in emulator use. The more people use
emulators, the more their use will spread. iPhones are also definitely
powerful enough to run emulators; the newer the iPhone, the faster the
emulation. An iPhone X R, for example, is powerful enough to run a
Playstation Portable game at full speed, even while not being
optimized for the hardware, and being interpreted. It's like running
nearly a PS3 game using Python. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVkYhCmq-dI">A video I
made</a> demonstrates this.
The game, Dissidia DuoDecim, isn't as accessible as its predecessor.
However, it runs, as far as I could tell, at full speed. This
spectacularly shows that the computers in our pockets, the ones we use
to drone over Facebook, be riled up by news sites, or play Pokemon Go,
are much more powerful, and are capable of far more than what we use
of them.</p>
<p>Also, since blind people will have access to the code ran with XCode,
fixes to sound, the user interface, and even enhancements to both, are
possible. PSP games could be enhanced using Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/audio/">3D audio
effects</a>. Games could be described
using Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision">Machine Learning
Vision</a> technology.
This applies to even more than accessibility, however. Since more users
will be learning to code, or finally have the ability to code for iOS,
bugs in iOS ports of open source software can more quickly be resolved.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, I have discussed the possibility of XCode for iOS, and
how it could improve learning to code, sideloading apps, and emulation
of video games. I hope that this information has been informative, and
has enlivened the imaginations of my readers.</p>
<p>Now, what do you all think? Are you a blind person who wants to learn to
code in an accessible environment? Are you a sighted person who wants to
play Final Fantasy VII on your phone? Or are you one who wants to help
fix accessibility issues in apps? Discussion is very welcome, anywhere
this post is shared to. I welcome any feedback, input, or corrections.
And, as always, thank you so much for reading this article.</p>

<p>Whenever you read a text message, forum post, Tweet, or Facebook
status, have you ever seen some one surround a word with stars, like
<code>*this*</code>? Have you noticed some one surround a phrase with two stars?
This is Markdown, a form of formatting text for web usage.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that Markdown deserves more than just web usage. I
can write in Markdown in this blog, I can use it on Github, and even
in a few social networks. But wouldn’t it be even more useful
everywhere? If we could write in Markdown throughout the whole
operating system, couldn’t we be more expressive? And for
accessibility issues, Markdown is great because a blind person can
just write to format, instead of having to deal with clunky, slow
interfaces.</p>
<p>So, in this article, I will discuss the importance of rich text, how
Markdown could empower people with disabilities, and how it could work
system-wide throughout all computers, even the ones in our pockets.</p>
<h3>What’s this rich text and who needs all that?</h3>
<p>Have you ever written in Notepad? It’s pretty plain, isn’t it? That is
plain text. No bold, no italics, no underline, nothing. Just, if you
like that, plain, simple text. If you don’t like plain text, you find
yourself wanting more power, more ability to link things together,
more ways to describe your text and make the medium, in some ways, a
way to get the message across.</p>
<p>Because of this need, rich text was created. One can use this in Word
Pad, Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, or any other word
processor worth something. When I speak of rich text, to make things
simple, I mean anything that is not plain text, including HTML, as it
describes rich text. Rich text is in a lot of places now, yes, but it
is not everywhere, and is not the same in the places that it is in.</p>
<p>So, who needs all that? Why not just stick with plain text? I mean
come on man, you’re blind! You can’t see the rich text. In a way, this
is true. I cannot see the richness of text, but in a moment, we’ll get
to how that can be done. But for sighted people, which text message is
better?</p>
<p>Okay, but how’s your day going?</p>
<p>Okay, but how’s <em>your</em> day going?</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">Okay, but how’s *your* day going?</span>
</pre>
<p>For blind people, the second message has the word “your” italicized.
Sure, we may have gotten used to stars surrounding words meaning
something, but that is a workaround, and not nearly the optimal
outcome of rich text.</p>
<p>So what can you do with Markdown? You can do plenty of stuff. You
could use it for simply using one blank line between blocks of text to
show paragraphs in your journal. You could use it to create headings
for chapters in your book. You could use it to make links to websites
in your email. You could even simply use it to italicize an emphasized
word in a text. Markdown can be as little or as much as you need it
to. And if you don’t add any stars, hashes, dashes, brackets, or HTML
markup, it’s just as it is, plain text.</p>
<p>Also, it doesn’t have to be hard. Even Emacs, an advanced text editor,
gives you questions when you add a link, like “Link text,” “Link
address,” and so on. Questions like that can be asked of you, and you
simply fill in the information, and the Markdown is created for you.</p>
<h3>Okay but what about us blind people?</h3>
<p>To put it simply, Markdown shows us rich text. In the next section,
I’ll talk about how, but for now, let’s focus on why. With nearly all
screen readers, text formatting is not shown to us. Only Narrator on
Windows 10 shows formatting with minimal configuration, and JAWS can
be used to show formatting using much configuration of speech and
sound schemes.</p>
<p>But, do we want that kind of information? I think so. Why wouldn’t we
want to know exactly what a sighted person sees, in a way that we can
easily, and quickly, understand? Why would we not want to know what an
author intended us to know in a book? We accept formatting symbols in
Braille, and even expect it. So, why not in digital form?</p>
<p>NVDA on Windows can be set to speak formatting information as we read,
but it can be bold on quite arduous to hear italics on all this
italics off as we read what we write bold off. Orca can speak
formatting like NVDA, as well. VoiceOver on the Mac can be set to
speak formatting, like NVDA, and also has the ability to make a small
sound when it encounters formatting. This is better, but how would one
distinguish bold, italics, or underline from a simple color change?</p>
<p>Even VoiceOver on iOS, which arguably gets much more attention than
its Mac sibling, cannot read formatting information. The closest we
get is the phrase separated from the rest of the paragraph into its
own item, showing that it’s different, in Safari and other web apps.
But how is it different? What formatting was applied to this
“different” text? Otherwise, text is plain, so no blind people even
know that there is a possibility of formatting, let alone that that
formatting isn’t made known to us by the program tasked with giving us
this information. In some apps, like notes, one can get some
formatting information by reading line by line in the Note text field,
but what if one simply wants to read the whole thing?</p>
<p>Okay but what about writing rich text? I mean, you just hit a hotkey
and it works, so what could be better than that? First, when you press
Control + I to italicize, there is no guarantee that “italics on” will
be spoken. In fact, that is the case in LibreOffice for Windows: you
do not know if the toggle key toggled the formatting on or off. You
could write some text, select it, then format it, but again, you don’t
know if you just italicized that text, or removed the italics. You may
be able to check formatting with your screen reader’s command, but
that’s slow, and you would hate to do that all throughout the
document. Furthermore, dealing with spoken formatting as it is, it
takes some time to read your formatted text. Hearing descriptions of
formatting changes tires the mind, as it must interpret the fast-paced
speech, get a sense of formatting flipped from off to on, and quickly
return to interpreting text instead of text formatting instruction.
Also, because all text formatting changes are spoken like the text
surrounding it, you may have to slow down your speech just to get
somewhat ahead of things enough to not grow tired from the relentless
text streaming through your mind. This could be the case with star
star bold or italics star star, and if screen readers would use more
fine control of the pauses of a speech synthesizer, a lot of the
exhausting sifting through of information which is rapidly fired at us
would be lessened, but I don’t see much of that happening any time
soon.</p>
<p>Even on iOS, where things are simpler, one must deal with the same
problems as on other systems, except knowing if formatting is turned
on or off before writing. There is also the problem of using the touch
screen, using menus just to select to format a heading. This can be
worked around using a Bluetooth keyboard, if the program you’re
working in even has a keyboard command to make a heading, but not
everyone has, or wants, one of those.</p>
<p>Markdown fixes, at least, most of this. We can <em>write</em> in Markdown,
controlling our formatting exactly, and <em>read</em> in Markdown, getting
much more information than we ever have before, while also getting
less excessive textual information, hearing “star” instead of “italics
on” and “italics off” does make a difference. “Star” is not usually
read surrounding words, and has already become, in a sense, a
formatting term. “Italics on” sounds like plain text, is not a symbol,
and while it is a formatting term, has many syllables, and just takes
time to say. Coupled with the helpfulness of Markdown for people
without disabilities, adding it across an entire operating system
would be useful for <em>everyone</em>; not just the few people with
disabilities, and not just for the majority without.</p>
<h3>So, how could this work?</h3>
<p>Operating systems, the programs which sit between you and the programs
you run, has many layers and parts working together to make the
experience as smooth as the programmers know how. In order for
Markdown to be understood, there must be a part of the operating
system that translates it into something that the thing that displays
text understands. Furthermore, this thing must be able to display the
resulting rich text, or Markdown interpretation, throughout the whole
system, not just in Google Docs, not just in Pages, not just in Word,
but in Note Pad, in Messages, in Notes, in a search box.</p>
<p>With that implemented, though, how should it be used? I think that
there should be options. It’s about time some companies released their
customers from the “one size fits all” mentality anyway. There should
be an option to replace formatting done with Markdown with rich text
unless the line the formatting is on has input focus, a mode for
simply showing the Markdown only and no rich text, and an option for
showing both.</p>
<p>For sighted people, I imagine seeing Markdown would be distracting.
They want to see a heading, not the hash mark that makes the line a
heading. So, hide Markdown unless that heading line is navigated to.</p>
<p>For blind people, or for people who find plain text easier to work
with, and for whom the display of text in different sizes and font
faces is jarring or distracting, having Markdown only would be great,
while being translated for others to see as rich text. Blind people
could write in Markdown, and others can see it as rich text, while the
blind person sees simply what they wrote, in Markdown.</p>
<p>For some people, being able to see both would be great. Being able to
see the Markdown they write, along with the text that it produces,
could be a great way for users to become more comfortable with
Markdown. It could be used for beginners to rich text editing, as
well.</p>
<h4>But, which version of Markdown should be used?</h4>
<p>As with every open source, or heatedly debated, thing in this world,
there are many ways of doing things. Markdown is no different. There
is <a href="https://github.com/mmark-md/mmark">strict Markdown</a>, <a href="https://commonmark.org">Common
Mark</a>, <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">Github Flavored
Markdown</a>, <a href="https://nshipster.com/swift-documentation/">Swift
Markdown</a>, <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">Pandoc
Markdown</a>, and probably many others. I
think that Pandoc’s Markdown would be the best, most extended variant
to use, but I know that most operating system developers will stick
with their own. Apple will stick with Swift Markdown, Microsoft may
stick with Github Markdown, and the Linux developers may use Pandoc,
if Pandoc is available as a package on the user’s architecture, and if
not, then it’s some one else’s issue.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this article, I have attempted to communicate the importance of
rich text, why Markdown would make editing rich text easy for
everyone, including people with disabilities, and how it could be
implemented. So now, what do you all think? Would Markdown be helpful
for you? Would writing blog posts, term papers, journal entries, text
messages, notes, or Facebook posts be enhanced by Markdown rich text?
For blind people, would reading books, articles, or other text, and
hearing the Markdown for bold, italics, and other such formatting make
the text stand out more, make it more beautiful to you, or just get in
your way? For developers, what would it take to add Markdown support
to an operating system, or even your writing app? How hard will it be?</p>
<p>Please, let me know your thoughts, using the contact info, or replying
to the posts on social media made about this article. And, as always,
thank you so much for reading this post.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, my Airpods Pro began making a clicking sound, when
in Noise Cancellation or transparency mode. I didn’t think much of it,
and just used them regularly, until sound began distorting after a
while of listening. I’ve simply stopped using them, as I shudder to
think how much a cab ride to the nearest Apple Store, potentially an
hour away, would cost. This is only one problem with the Apple
ecosystem: being locked into Apple’s wireless headphones, other
Bluetooth headphones, or other workarounds, and Apple Stores being far
away, which is what I’ll be focusing on in this article. I will show,
in the following paragraphs, how Apple’s handling of its ecosystem
effects the hardware and software regarding accessibility matters.
These matters may effect some in the general population, but people
with disabilities are effected much more acutely.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Apple’s hardware has usually been very well built. Reviewers often
talk about nothing else. From the iPhone’s camera, iPad’s screen,
Mac’s CPU and RAM, to the Watch’s health sensors, and the Airpod’s H1
chip, hardware, for Apple, is a big part of their products, and
reviewers focus on that. But how does that help or hinder accessibility?</p>
<h3>The TouchBar on the Mac</h3>
<p>In late 2016, Apple’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro">MacBook Pro</a> gained the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/touch-bar-mchlbfd5b039/mac">Touch Bar</a>, a touch strip
across the top of the keyboard, replacing the function keys. The
reason was to add variable icons which could visibly change functions
across the operating system. Many people may have liked this change,
as they could use hand-eye coordination to perform functions they
otherwise would have used the trackpad and menus for. These type of
users would not have known about keyboard shortcuts, using the
function keys, and other easy ways of getting the same functions done
without needing yet another touch input.</p>
<p>Blind people, however, are a bit different. We usually know many
keyboard shortcuts, use the function keys without a problem, and do
not always need a touch screen. The Touch Bar can be used, but it is
much slower, as we have no tactile way of finding just one distinct
item on the touch bar, like the play/pause button, or the volume
slider. Once we have found the function we want, we must tap it twice
to activate, like a sighted person must left click twice, once to
focus the item, the next to activate it. In fact, VoiceOver, the
screen reader for the Mac, had to adopt a command to raise or lower
the volume via keyboard, since it is slower to do so on the Touch Bar.
On the other hand, most operating system and application features can
be accessed via keyboard commands, so I only need to use the Touch Bar
for system functions like volume, brightness of the screen, and media
playback when I’m not in the media player.</p>
<p>If a blind person wants to use their Mac as a Windows machine also,
through Bootcamp, they must attach an external keyboard, or simply not
use the function keys, as Windows screen readers have no such notion
of a Touch Bar function key row, thus will not read what a user is
selecting, and will also not let a user explore the touch bar to find
a function before activating them, so one touch activates an item,
even if it isn’t the one a user wants. See <a href="https://www.applevis.com/forum/macbook-pro-touch-bar-windows-10">this Applevis forum post</a>
for more information on this.</p>
<p>I feel that Apple should have made this change on the MacBook Air, for
regular consumers, and left the Pro machines alone. Yes, they could
have made the power button into the Touch ID button on the pro
machines, and I hope that, just as they revived the scissor-switch
keyboards, they revive the Function keys as well. It would help me
greatly in doing even simple tasks easier, like pausing, skipping, and
rewinding audio, and handling volume and brightness more quickly.</p>
<p>There is still hope, however. This year, Apple released the MacBook
Air refresh with the new keyboard. It has an Escape key, at least.
Now, they just need to add back the other twelve keys on that row, and
things will be back to normal.</p>
<h3>The headphone jack</h3>
<p>In 2016’s iPhone 7 and 7+, Apple removed the headphone jack, replacing
it with their own Airpods, other Bluetooth headphones, and Lightning
audio. They did not add another Lightning port onto the phone so that
one could listen to wired headphones and charge the phone at the same
time, or, as they did with the TouchBar on the MacBook, but left
people to choose between wireless options if one wanted to be able to
listen and charge the phone.</p>
<p>For most people, this isn’t an issue. They don’t usually need
headphones, only using them when listening to music or movies, or
playing games. Even then, some people just listen on speakers built
into their phone, or use external speakers, like the HomePod. They
also do not have to worry about latency. Music is not effected by it,
and videos are usually delayed, so that the picture synchronizes with
the audio.</p>
<p>For blind people, however, headphones are important. In order to use
an iPhone, most blind people use a screen reader, which speaks
information out loud using a voice like the one Siri uses. Using a
screen reader without headphones means that anyone nearby can hear
what the user’s phone is saying, which can reveal sensitive
information like the phone numbers of people who call or text the
person, user passwords, and even the pass code to their phone. This
means that headphones are quite necessary. Some blind people own
Braille displays, which gets output from a screen reader and displays
it in braille, but these devices are expensive, starting at $600, up
to near $6000, so are out of most blind people’s price ranges.</p>
<p>Wireless headphones, using Bluetooth, often have large lags when being
used. If you play a game using them, you’ll surely notice it. A blind
person who uses Bluetooth headphones must deal with that for all
interactions with the phone. Imagine having to deal with a phone with
a screen that lags behind what you’re doing on the phone, even by 300
Milliseconds. Some Bluetooth headphones are better, but none can match
wired ones. Apple’s Airpods 2 and Airpods Pro come closer, but have
their own problems: they still must be charged, have lesser battery
life, and cost much for the sound quality they come with.</p>
<p>To solve all of these problems, I have bought a $10 Lightning to 3.5
Millimeter Headphone adapter, and use that with the headphones that I
already have. Sure, I have to take my iPhone with me in my pocket
wherever I go, but I usually do that anyways now that my Apple Watch
is broken also. Sure, I don’t have my Lightning connector free, but I
have a charging mat that I use to charge the phone. There is no lag
when using VoiceOver, the sound quality is very good, and I don’t have
to charge my headphones.</p>
<p>Hope is not lost, however. There is a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-13-rumor-wireless-no-lightning-charging-port-2019-12">rumor</a> that iPhones could be
completely wireless. Of course, one still must plug the iPhone into a
computer, so it could be like the older MacBook products with a
magnetic spot to plug dongles into. In this case, a third-party dongle
could add the Lightning and headphone jack back to the iPhone.</p>
<h3>The Home button and TouchID</h3>
<p>In 2017, Apple shipped the iPhone X, the first iPhone without a home
button. This was meant to extend the iPhone’s screen completely across
the bottom of the screen, even though they had to notch the screen at
the top. Along with the removal of the home button, they added FaceID.
This replaced TouchID as the authentication method for unlocking the
device in general usage of the phone.</p>
<p>Most users do not have a problem with FaceID. They raise the phone to
look at it, and as they look at the camera, the phone unlocks. They
can then swipe the lock screen away from the bottom, revealing the
home screen. For sighted users, this is a quick, easy, and intuitive
motion.</p>
<p>For blind people, it isn’t so simple. We do not have to look at our
phones in order to use them. In fact, users with braille displays or
hardware, Bluetooth keyboards, do not have to touch their phone. These
users can easily and quickly enter their pass codes, however, so they
usually are not effected by this. Most users must pick up the phone,
wait for the unlock sound from the screen reader, then put it back
down on the surface they were using it on before. If FaceID doesn’t
work, they must angle the phone away and back again for another try.
if it fails a few more times, they must enter their pass code,
with headphones in, if they seek to preserve their privacy around
others.</p>
<p>Hope is not lost, however. There is a <a href="https://www.imore.com/iphone-9">rumor</a> that a new iPhone SE type
device, the iPhone 9, could be released this year with a home button,
TouchID, and still sport the A13 CPU. This would be something that I
myself may purchase, as I doubt there will be much greater features in
the iPhone 12, released later this year.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Apple’s software usually comes last in reviews. Reviewers may talk
about the smooth animations, camera machine learning effects, or
updates to apps. For users of Apple’s accessibility services, however,
software is the core experience of a device, and what sets MacOS apart
from Windows and Linux, and iOS apart from Android. I have covered
Apple’s accessibility options extensively <a href="https://geeksmodo.com/apples-accessibility-consistency/">elsewhere</a>, so I will use
this section to highlight parts of software which effect accessibility
indirectly.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper on MacOS</h3>
<p>For a pro machine, the Mac lately has become a mess of confirmation
dialog boxes and hindrances to opening software not blessed by Apple or
its notarization process. For most users, even most blind users, this
won’t be much of an issue. If you use Apple’s apps, or apps from the
App Store, you’ll be fine. But what happens when you want to use, say,
Emacs for editing text, or Retroarch for playing video games?</p>
<p>Blind people sometimes use specialized software to complete tasks. We
use apps on our phones for recognizing pictures, money, and images of
text, since these are not usually accessible to us. On the Mac, I use
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for editing text, using the <a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak">Emacspeak</a> extension, because I find
it much easier and more enjoyable than Text Edit, Pages, and other
alternatives. In fact, I am using Emacs right now, to write, and
publish, this blog post. However, this program is not notarized by
Apple’s processes, so instead of just being able to open it, I must
open it from the contextual menu, press “Cancel,” then open it again,
and press “Open.” My laptop is a pro machine; I should be treated as a
professional. These features, as with the Touch Bar, should be left to
MacBook Air users, or left for iPad users, when, or if, the iPad
becomes a general-purpose computer.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, I’ve explored how some of Apple’s decisions across
its ecosystem have effected accessibility. Hardware has changed much,
with software mainly being usable besides accessibility bugs and
overbearing security. More about direct accessibility in software and
services can be found in other articles. Other, smaller issues include
the lack of Apple Stores is smaller cities, turning on iPhone not
producing a vibration, sound, or other way for a blind person to
immediately know when it has turned on, and the Mac’s startup chime
disabled by default.</p>
<p>Now, what do you think, readers? I’d love to have your feedback, and
thank you for reading.</p>

<p>This article will be something rather different from my normal
postings. I’ve decided to begin doing news posts, rather than just my
ramblings. Oh, there will still be rambles, as I have an opinion on
everything, and readers might as well know the person I am, to
understand more about my viewpoint, to gauge the content relative to
the content writer.</p>
<p>The scope of the news will vary, but I expect it to be mostly open
source technology, relevant to the blind community. This may change,
as readers may always contact me requesting that I write articles or
news items about subjects. I will let the folks at <a href="https://www.blindbargains.com">Blind
Bargains</a> chase after Humanware,
Vispero, HIMS, and other such “big names” in the Assistive Technology
world. I seek for my content to be different, meaningful, and lacking
the comedic nature of Podcasts for the blind. Yes, I do have a slight
grudge against larger sites who can dictate, pretty well without fail,
what readers know about. After all, if a blind person only listens to
the Blind Bargains podcast, or even reads their news posts, will they
know about these advancements, like retroarch accessibility, Stormux, and so on? In
any case, with that out of the way, let’s be on with the news.</p>
<h2>Retroarch is accessible</h2>
<p>Retroarch, the program that brings many video game emulators together
into one unified interface, was made accessible in December 2019.
Along with its ability to grab text from the screen of games and speak
it, this brings accessibility to many games, on all 3 major operating
systems for desktop and laptop computers. No, Android and iOS cannot
benefit from this yet. Also, there is more to come.</p>
<p>For a detailed page on using Retroarch for the blind, see <a href="https://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroarch-accessibility-guide/">this
guide</a>.</p>
<h2>GTK 4 could be more accessible</h2>
<p>This year, folks from GTK met with some accessibility advocates. They
came up with <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/02/17/gtk-hackfest-2020-roadmap-and-accessibility/">this
roadmap</a>
for better accessibility. GTK is the way some Linux apps are given
graphical representations, like buttons, check boxes, and so on. As I
always say, the operating system is the root of accessibility, and the
stronger that root is, the more enjoyable it will be for blind people
to use Linux.</p>
<p>I hope that this will bring much more accessibility to GTK programs,
and get rid of a lot of reasons to stick with Mac or Windows for many
more technically inclined blind people, like myself. Yes, even I have
reservations about using it. Will it be good enough? Will I be able to
get work done? Will I be able to play the game I like most? Will it
require a lot of work? At least with better GTK accessibility, a few
of those questions will be better answered affirmatively.</p>
<h2>Mate 1.24 brings greater accessibility</h2>
<p>Last month, Mate released <a href="https://mate-desktop.org/blog/2020-02-10-mate-1-24-released/">version 1.24</a> of its desktop environment,
which is basically like a version of the Windows desktop, handling the
start menu, task bar, and other such aspects of a graphical interface.
Mate uses a system more like Windows XP, while other desktops, like
Gnome, are more new in their approaches.</p>
<p>Just search for “accessibility” on the linked page, and you’ll find
quite a few improvements. This is a great sign; I really like it when
organizations, or companies, display their accessibility commitment
proudly in updates, and not just the bland “bug fixes and performance
improvements” mantra tiredly used in most change logs today.</p>
<h2>Stormux: a distribution which might stick around</h2>
<p>After the quiet death of <a href="https://f123.org/en/">F123</a>, a contributor
to the blind Linux community, Storm, created a fork of F123, calling
it <a href="https://stormux.org/welcome-to-stormux/">Stormux</a>. The project is
new, and still has a few problems, but is designed to be a jumping off
point into Arch Linux, which is a more advanced, but very up-to-date,
variant of Linux. It is only available for the Raspberry Pi 4 computer
for now, and I will have a chance to test it soon. The website is as
new as the software, so the <a href="https://stormux.org/downloads/">downloads
section</a> is not linked to the main
page, neither is much else. In the coming months, both the website and
operating system should see some development.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This has been my first news article on this blog. I hope to write more
of these, along with my normal posts, as new developments occur.
However, I cannot know about everything, so if one of my readers finds
or creates something new, and wishes for it to be written about and
possibly read, please let me know. I will not turn away anyone because
of obscurity or lack of general perceived interest.</p>

<p>In a <a href="posts/2020-03-03-quick-apple-update/%7B%%20link%0A_posts/2020-02-13-accessibility-consistency.md%20%%7D">previous blog post</a>, I
talked about Apple having a few problems to fix. Last month, they
fixed one of them, being Apple Research. The hearing study now will
have accessible hearing tests and questions. Focus is still a little
jumpy in the Heart and Movement study questions, and my watch screen
has become a moving part so I can’t participate in that study
completely, or track my sleep accurately, but getting transportation
to the Apple Store is something I’ve covered well on Twitter already.</p>
<p>So, thanks so much to the people at Apple who handled the Research
accessibility to this point, and may it become even better, reversing
the trend started with the inaccessibility of Apple Arcade.</p>
